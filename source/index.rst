Welcome to CHARMM's documentation!
==================================

You are now using the INFO facility to view CHARMM 24 documentation. The paper; CHARMM: A Program for Macromolecular Energy, Minimization, and Dynamics Calculations. J. Comp. Chem., Vol. 4, p187 (1983), is considered to be an integral part of this documentation. In places, this documentation and the paper will conflict. In all such cases, the documentation presented here should take precedence.
