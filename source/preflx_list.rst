======================================
LIST OF ALL COMPILE KEYWORDS IN CHARMM
======================================

By employing appropriate preprocessor keys, one can generate a
variant of CHARMM.  This document list the preprocessor keywords used
in the CHARMM source code.  This list is still under construction and
requires developers to update upon modifying and indroducing codes.

In the listing, note the following description keys.
- member:       keyword grouping
- required:     list of keywords required for this keyword to be used properly.
- conflicting:  list of keywords/groups that cannot be used with this keyword.
- availability: If/How this keyword is generated by install.com
- note:         Any additional information about usage
