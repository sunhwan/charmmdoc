You are now using the INFO facility to view CHARMM 24
documentation.  The paper; CHARMM: A Program for Macromolecular
Energy, Minimization, and Dynamics Calculations. J. Comp. Chem., Vol.
4, p187 (1983), is considered to be an integral part of this
documentation.  In places, this documentation and the paper will
conflict.  In all such cases, the documentation presented here should
take precedence.
