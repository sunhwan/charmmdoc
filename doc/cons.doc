        The potential energy has a harmonic restraint term which allows
one to prevent large motions of individual atoms.  There are three forms
for this restraint, ABSOLUTE, BESTFIT, and RELATIVE.  It is possible to
combine multiple restraints in one energy calculation, but no atom may
participate in more than one harmonic restraint set.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ABSOLUTE positional restraints.

Absolute positional restraints specify a location a cartesian space where
an atom must remain proximal.  This is the original positional restraint
in CHARMM.  The form for this potential is as follows for coordinates:

  EC = sum over selected atoms of k(i)* [mass(i)] * (x(i)-refx(i))**exponent

where refx is a reference set of coordinates.  If MASS is specified in
the command line, then k is multiplied by the mass of the atom
resulting in a natural frequency of oscillation for the restraint 
of sqrt(k) in AKMA units.   An atom restrained with MASS FORCE 1.0
will oscillate at 8 cycles/picosecond if free of other interactions.
For most operations involving harmonic restraints, mass weighting is
recommended. There are three reasons for this. First, the results obtained
will be similar regardless of what atom representation is used
(extended vs. explicit) for hydrogen atoms. Second, Hydrogen atoms
are allowed greater relative freedom if present. And third, The character
of the normal modes of a molecule are unperturbed with mass weighting
(essential if normal modes or low frequency motions are of interest).

        Note, there is no longer a prefactor of 0.5 on the force
constant specification. This is appropriate in that exponent values
other than "2" are allowed. This differs from the earlier versions of
CHARMM (up to version 16).

       The restraint force constant can be set to any positive
value (specified by the FORCE keyword followed by the desired value).
The force constants may also be obtained from the weight array, in
which case the FORCe keyword is not read.  When using this option,
a negative values may be used for some atoms, however, the total weight
must be positive. 

      The reference coordinates can be the current set at the point when
restraints are specified (the default) or a set can be the comparison
set (COMP keyword).  When multiple CONS HARM commands are used, the
KEEP option preserves the reference coordinates from the previous
restraints.  This is useful in cases where the force constant is
to be modified, but no other changes are desired.

      The variables XSCAle, YSCAle, and ZSCAle are global scale factors
for ABSOLUTE harmonic restraint terms.  The default scale factor is 1.0 for
all terms.  If multiple harmonic restraint sets are used, they may have
different scale factors.  The RELATIVE and BESTFIT types do not allow a
scale factor at present.

Example:   CONS HARM FORCE 1.0 MASS SELE atom * * CA  END  COMP

This command harmonically restrains all alpha-carbons to the current
positions in the comparison coordinates with a force constant of
24 Kcals/mol/A**2 (assuming a mass of 12).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BESTFIT positional restraints

      This restraint is similar to the absolute restraints except that
the reference coordinates are (implicitly) rotated and translated so
as to bestfit the selected atoms.  This best fit is done in a manner that
minimizes the restraint energy.  Due to the nature of the best fit, this
restraint term does not add any net force or torque to the system.

Note 1: An exponent may not be specified (it is set to 2)
Note 2: Global scale factors do not apply
Note 3: At present, there is no Hessian code for this restrain
Note 4: There is no energy partition (ANAL command) for this restraint

Example:  CONS HARM BESTFIT  MASS FORCE 1.0 COMP SELE SEGID A END
          CONS HARM BESTFIT  MASS FORCE 1.0 COMP SELE SEGID B END

These commands will restrain segments A and B to the geometries they have
in the current comparison coordinates.  This restraint will not add a net
force or torque to the system (unlike the ABSOLUTE restraint type).  Segments
A and B can move (rotate/translate) independently with no change in the
restraint energy.  See also CONS RMSD below.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RELATIVE positional restraints.

      The relative positional restraints are similar to the bestfit
restraint except there is no reference coordinates.  In this case,
one part of the system is restrained to have the same shape as another
part of the system.  The two restraint sets are implicitly bestfit
by an optimal rotation/translation (minimizing the restraint energy).
Both sets of atoms 

Note 1: An exponent may not be specified (it is set to 2)
Note 2: Global scale factors do not apply
Note 3: At present, there is no Hessian code for this restrain
Note 4: There is no energy partition (ANAL command) for this restraint
Note 5: The atoms of the two sets are matched on-to-one in sequential order.
Note 6: If the two sets do not have the same number of atoms, an
            error will be issued and the set lists will be truncated.
Note 7: Both sets must be specified and must not use set number 1.

Example:
  CONS HARM RELATIVE WEIGHT SELE segid a1 END SELE segid a2 END NOROT NOTRAN

This command will force two replicas (A1 and A2) to have the same coordinates
based on the values in the weighting array (as best fit weights).

Example: CONS HARM RELATIVE MASS FORCE 10.0 SELE SEGID A END SELE SEGID B END

This command will force two segments (A and B) to have the same shape, but
they may have very different locations and orientations.  Atoms are matched
one-to-one by selected atom number.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GENERAL INFORMATION 

      It is important to understand some aspects of how the restraints are
set in order to get the most flexibility out of this command. When CHARMM
is loaded, each atom has associated with it a harmonic force constant
initially set to zero. Each call to the CONS HARM command changes the value
of this constant for only those atoms specified.  When this command is
invoked with an atom selection (and KEPP is not specified), only the
reference coordinates (XREF,YREF,ZREF) for selected atoms are modified.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
Each atom may participate in AT MOST one harmonic restraint term.
This is a coding limitation designed to maximize compatibility with older
CHARMM scripts (i.e. doing a series of minimizations with a decreasing
series of force constants).  This could be easily modified with a bit of
work to increase the capability (at the expense of script compatibility).

      When multiple restraint sets are used, it is important to note
that all selections should be exclusive.  When they are not exclusive,
then atoms will be assigned to the restraint of the most recent
CONS HARM command which selected that atom.  In other words, the restraint
set number is an atomic property.  If restraint sets are broken up, then an
error message will be issued.  If an entire set is replaced, then the new
restraint replaces the old one (without a warning message).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OTHER COMMANDS:

        The harmonic restraints may no longer be read and written to files.
The PRINT command still functions for harmonic restraints for information.
To examine or modify the internal harmonic restrain data, the SCALar
command (arrays: CONStraints,XREF,YREF, and ZREF) may be used
(see *Note scalar::(chmdoc/scalar) ).   In addition, one may look at
the contributions to the energy in detail using the ANALysis command,
see *note anal:(chmdoc/analys).

                  Holding dihedrals near selected values

        Using this form of the CONS command, one may put restraints on
the dihedral angles formed by sets of any four atoms. The improper
torsion potential is used to maintain said angles.

        The command for setting the dihedral restraints is as follows:

Syntax:

[SYNTAX CONS DIHEdral]

CONS DIHEdral [BYNUM int int int int] [FORCe real] [MIN real] [PERIod int] 
              [   atom-selection    ]              [ COMP   ]   [WIDTh real]
              [     4X(atom-spec)   ]              [ MAIN   ]

                    
CONS CLDH

Syntactic ordering:  DIHE or CLDH must follow CONS, and FORCE, MIN and
PERIod  must follow DIHE.

where:      atom-spec ::= { segid resid iupac }
                          { resnumber iupac   }


        DIHEdral adds a torsion angle to the list of restrained angles
using the specified atoms, force constant, minimum and periodicity.
If an atom selection is used, then the first 4 selected atoms (in order)
will define the dihedral angle.  If either MAIN or COMP is specified and
[MIN real] is not, then the minimum angle value will be determined by
the current dihedral angle value in the corresponding coordinate set.

If the PERIodicity is zero (improper type), then the force constant
has units of kcal/mol/radian/radian, else it has units of kcal/mol.

   Ecdih = FORCE * max(0, abs( phi - MIN*pi/180) - WIDTH)**2  [ PERIod = 0 ]
   Ecdih = FORCE * (1-cos( PERIod* (phi - MIN*pi/180 )) )     [ PERIod > 0 ]

CLDH clears the list of restrained dihedrals so that different angles
or new restraint parameters can be specified.

Other commands:

        The PRINT CONS command, see *note print:(chmdoc/io.doc)print,
will work for restraints.

                Holding Internal Coordinates near selected values

[SYNTAX CONS IC]

Syntax:

CONStraint IC  [BOND real [EXPOnent integer] [UPPEr]]
                   [ANGLe real] [DIHEdral real] [IMPRoper real]

        Using this form of the CONS command, one may put restraints on
any internal coordinate. For this energy term, the IC table is
used.  At each energy call, the reference (zero-force) value of each IC
is set to the value currently in the IC table.
All nonzero bond entries are restrained with the bond constant,
using the optional EXPOnent (default 2) in the potential K*(S-S0)**EXPOnent.
Second derivatives are currently supported only with EXPOnent=2.
The angle, dihedral, and improper terms are only harmonic.
The DIHEdral term only applies to IC's of normal type, and the
IMPRoper term only applies to the improper IC type (those with a "*")

If UPPEr is specified the reference bond length is taken as an upper
limit and the restraint potential is applied only if S>S0; this is
intended for use with distance restraints from NMR NOE data.
All nonzero angle entries are restrained with the angle constant. All
dihedrals are restrained with the dihedral constant using the improper
dihedral energy potential. If any IC entry contains an undefined atom
(zeroes), then the associated bonds,angles, and dihedral will not be
restrained.

      The force constant has units of kcal/mol/radian/radian for both
angle and dihedral restraints.  The bond force constant has units of
kcal/mol/angstrom**EXPOnent.

        This restraint term is very flexible in that the user may
chose which bonds... to restrain by editing an IC table. The major
drawback is that all bonds must have the same force constant. The same is
true for angles and dihedrals. By listing some IC's several times, the
effective force constant is increased. Also, if only angle restraints are
desired, then the bond and dihedral constants can be set to zero eliminating
their contribution.

        This restraint term is designed to put the entire molecule
in a cage. Is is based on the center of mass (or center of geometry if
NOMAss is specified) so that no net force or torque is introduced by this
restraint term. The potential function is;

        Edroplet= FORC* sum over atoms (( r-rcm )**EXPO )*mass(i))

                    How to fix atoms rigidly in place

[SYNTAX CONS FIX]

Syntax: CONS FIX atom-selection-spec { [PURG]                     }
                                     { [BOND] [THET] [PHI] [IMPH] }

        This command will fix all selected atoms and unfix all non-selected
atoms.  For example, the command; CONS FIX SELE NONE END 
will remove all fixing of atoms (except for lonepairs).

        This command fixes atoms in place by setting flags in an array
(IMOVE) which tells the minimization and dynamics alogrithms which atoms
are free to move. If atoms are fixed, it is possible to save
computer time by not calculating energy terms which involve only fixed
atoms. The nonbond and hydrogen bond algorithms in CHARMM check IMOVE
and delete pairs of atoms that are fixed in place from the nbond and
hbond lists respectively. In addition the PURG or individual energy term
options specified with the CONS FIX command allow all or some of the
internal coordinate energies associated with fixed atoms to be deleted.
Interactions between fixed and moving atoms are maintained.

*** NOTE *** because some energy terms are deleted from fixed systems,
the total energy calculated with fixed atoms will be different from the
total energy of the same system with all atoms free. The forces on the
moveable atoms will however be identical.  The purpose of this feature is
to remove the computational cost of energy terms that do not change for
simulations where a large fraction of the atoms are fixed.  It is not
recommended for any other purpose.

        The way CHARMM keeps track of fixed atoms is by the IMOVE array
in the PSF. The IMOVE array is 0 if the atom is free to move, and has
the value 1 if it is fixed.  A value of -1 indicates that this atom 
is a lonepair. 

***** WARNING ***** The purge options modify the PSF. The effects of
this command cannot be undone by the subsequent releasing of atoms.

***** WARNING ***** The fixing of atoms does not work for constant
pressure simulations.

                  Constrain centers of mass for selected atoms

[SYNTAX CONS HMCM]

Syntax: CONS HMCM FORCe real [WEIGhting] reference-spec atom-selection
 
where:
        reference-spec ::= REFX real REFY real REFZ real
                               
        This command will harmonically restrain centers of mass from the
selected atoms to the absolute reference point specified with REFX, REFY and
REFZ. The force constant of the harmonic potential is set with the FORCe 
keyword. Mass weighting is switched off by default but can be selected
by using the WEIG key. 

        The primary use of this command is during the reconstruction of
all-atom representations from low resolution models with virtual particles
at side chain centers.

        Example:

        CONS HMCM FORCE 50.0 WEIG REFX 10.4 REFY 12.1 REFZ 1.3 -
             SELECT RESID 21 .AND. .NOT. -
             ( TYPE H* .OR. TYPE N .OR. TYPE C .OR. TYPE O ) -
             END

        This will create a harmonic restraint with a force constant
of 50 kcal/mol that holds the side chain center of mass at residue 21
of a protein near (10.4, 12.1, 1.3).


File: Cons, Node: SHAKE, Up: Top, Next: NOE, Previous: Center of Mass

                Fixing bond lengths or angles during dynamics.

        SHAKE is a method of fixing bond lengths and, optionally, bond
angles during dynamics, minimization (not ABNR and Newton-Raphson methods),
coordinate modification (COOR SHAKe command), and vibrational analysis
(explore command). The method was brought to CHARMM by Wilfred Van
Gunsteren (WFVG), and is referenced in J. Comp. Phys. 23:327 (1977).
When hydrogens are present in a structure, it will allow a two-fold
increase in the dynamics step size if SHAKE is used on the bonds.

        To use SHAKE, one specifies the SHAKE command before any
SHAKE constraints usage. The SHAKE command has the following syntax:

[SYNTAX SHAKe constraints]


SHAKE { OFF                                               } 
      { shake-opt  fast-opt  2x(atom-selection) [NOREset] }

shake-opt:== [BONH]  { [MAIN]     } [TOL real] [MXITer integer]
             [BOND]  { COMP       }
             [ANGH]  { PARAmeters }        [SHKScale real] 
             [ANGL] 

fast-opt:== { [ FAST  [ WATEr water-resn ] ] }
            {   NOFAst                       }

        BONH specifies that all bonds involving hydrogens are to be
fixed. BOND specifies all bonds. ANGH specifies that all angles
involving hydrogen must be fixed. ANGL specifies that all angles must be
shaken. BOND is implied if any angles are fixed, otherwise, only the 1-3
distances would be fixed. Coordinates must be read in before the SHAKE
command is issued, unless the PARAmeter option is specified.

      SHAKE constraints are applied only for atom pairs where one atom
is in the first atom selection and one atom in the second atom selection.
The default atom selection is ALL for both sets.  

        TOL specifies the allowed relative deviations from the reference
values (default: 10**-10). MXITer is the maximum number of iterations
SHAKE tries before giving up (default: 500).

        When the SHAKE command is used, it will check that there are
degrees of freedom available for all atoms to satisfy all their
constraints. Angles cannot be fixed with SHAKE if one has explicit
hydrogen arginines in the structure as the CZ carbon has too many
constraints. This is a general problem for any structure which has too
many branches close together.

        SHAKE is not recommended for fixing angles. The algorithm
converges very slowly in the case where one has three angles centered on
a tetravalent atom and the constraints are satisfiable only using out of
plane motions.

        The use of SHAKE modifies the output of the dynamics command.
The number appearing to the right of the step number is the number of
iterations SHAKE required to satisfy all the constraints. This number
should generally be small.

        When ST2's are present, SHAKE constraints are automatically
applied for the O-H bonds and H-O-H angles.

        There is a PARAmeter option for the SHAKe command. This option
causes the shake bond distances to be found from the parameter table
rather than from the current set of coordinates. This option is
NOT compatible with the use on angle SHAKE constraints, and it will
give an error if this is tried.

        With these commands, the bond energy may be zeroed without
any minimization with the command sequence;
        SHAKE BOND PARA
        COOR SHAKE [MASS]

[SYNTAX SHAKe FAST constraints]
SHAKe FAST [WATEr SELEct water_selection END] [OLDWatershake]
         [ MXITer <iterations> TOL <tolerance> ] [PARAmeter] [COMP]
   This command specifies the use of the new vector/parallel and analagous
   scalar fast SHAKE constraint routines (implemented Aug 2000). 
   Certain assumptions are made when
   this command is issued: The only bonds involved are between heavy atoms
   and hydrogens, except for water molecules included in the 
   WATEr selection ... end sub-command.
   This selection is used to indicate the water molecules
   that have an H-H bond. It is assumed that the selection will include
   all atoms in the water molecule and that said molecule contains exactly
   two X-H bonds and one H-H bond where X is any heavy atom.  Testing
   for "hydrogen-ness" is done via the CHARMm hydrog() function which
   makes it's choice based on atomic mass.  The prefered selection is
   through the use of the RESNAME selection specifier, eg:

       ... WATEr SELEct RESNAME TIP3 END

   By default, water molecules selected with the WATEr sub-command will
   be constrained via the use of a special water-SHAKE routine which
   uses the direct inversion method. This algorithm is from 25 to 30 %
   faster than the normal iterative, scalar SHAKE routine. For the rest
   of the heavy atom -hydrogen bonds, a vector/parallel version of
   the original SHAKE routine is used.  This is about 5X the scalar SHAKE.
   If the optional keyword OLDWatershake is used, the vector/parallel
   (not the watershake) routines are used.

   The rest of the keywords are the same as in the original SHAKE command.
   Note: that FAST has to be the second word in command line.

            where the square-well function is used for distances within a
            specified "switching" region (specified by the RSWItch keyword),
            whereas outside this region a "soft" asymptote is used: 

 
                   / 0.5*KMIN*(RAVE-RMIN)**2                    R<=RMIN
            E(NOE)=  0.0                                   RMIN<R< RMAX

                   \ A+B/(RAVE-RMAX)**SEXP+FMAX*(RAVE-RMAX)     R> RMAX+RSWITCH

            where,
             
                A,B  are determined such that both E and force are continuous.
                FMAX defines the final asymptote slope (default 1.0)
                RSWI defines the switching start point (default 1.0)    
                SEXP exponent of the soft asymptote    (default 1.0)

            and

                     RRAVE=RRAVE*(1-DELTA/TCON)+R**(-3)*DELTA/TCON

            for initial conditions, RRAVE=RMAX**(-3)
            DELTA is the integration time step.  For minimization,
            the value is either 0.001ps or the previous simulation value.

            Where: RLIM = RMAX+FMAX/KMAX (the value of RAVE where the
                                          force equals FMAX)

      Apply general restrained distances allowing multiple distances to
be specified.  This restraint term has been added to allow for facile
searching of a reaction coordinate, where the reaction coordinate is
estimated to be a linear combination of several distances.

      By Bernard R. Brooks - NIH - March, 1995

[SYNTAX Restrained Distances]

RESDistance [ RESEt ] [ SCALE real ] [ KVAL real  RVAL real [EVAL integer] -
       [ POSItive ] [ IVAL integer ]  repeat( real first-atom second-atom ) ]
       [ NEGAtive ]


   E = 1/EVAL *  Kval * Dref**EVAL

   Where:

   Dref =  K1*R1**Ival + K2*R2**Ival + ... + Kn*Rn**Ival - Rval

   Where K1,K2,...Kn are the real values in the repeat section and
   R1,R2,...Rn are the distances between specified pair of atoms.



   RESEt       Reset the restraint lists. This command clears the
               existing restraints. Resets the scale factor to 1.0

   SCALe real  Set the scale factor for the energy and forces.
               Default value: 1.0

   POSITIVE    Include this restraint only when Dref is positive.
   NEGATIVE    Include this restraint only when Dref is negative.

If anything else is on the command line then a new restraint is added to the
list of distance restraints.
      KVAL real     The force harmonic constant
      RVAL real     The target distance
      IVAL integer  The exponent for individual distances.
      EVAL integer  The exponent (default 2). EVAL must be positive.
      repeat( real first-atom second-atom )
            The real value is a scale factor for the distance between
            the first and second specified atoms in the pair.

  or oscillating in time: FORCe*COS(TWOPI*TIME/PERIod), FORCe <pN> PERIod <ps>
    time is counted from the start of the dynamcis run.
  The force due to an electrical EFIEld (V/m) (possibly also oscillating)
  may also be specified, in which case partial charges are taken from the psf
  and used to calculate the force.
  If WEIGht is specified the forces are multiplied by the wmain array.

  Each invocation of this command adds a set of forces to the previously
  defined set. 

  The invocation of a non-zero SWITch value will result in a linearly
  time-varying force. This command must be used in conjunction with a dynamics
  routine (using leap-frog integrator). The force is switched linearly between
  SFORce <pN> (starting force) and FORCe <pN> (end force) over the course of
  the dynamics simulation. 

  PULL OFF turns off all these forces.
  PULL LIST produces a listing. NB! Forces defined by PULL will move
  atoms in the specified direction, which is opposite to that listed
  by the forces from the COOR FORCE command.


File: Cons, Node: RMSD restraints, Up: Top, Previous: External Forces, Next: Rg/RMSD restraint

The RMSD restraint is useful to manipulate and control macromolecular
conformations.  The restraint is related to the CONS HARM BestFit, which sets
up harmonic restraints with respect of a reference structure.  However,
because all the reference data structure is stored in XREF, YREF, ZREF,
this command allows only a single bestfit restraint.  In addition, it allows
only a restraint to zero value of RMSD.  It is useful to allow multiple such
bestfit RMSD restraint to progress from one conformation to a second
conformation of a molecular system.  The new command CONS RMSD allows such
multiple bestfit restraint.   In fact, that is principally the advantage over
the BESTfit method (only the data structure is changed, the energy subroutines
themselves are the same).  The method can also be used to performed targetted
trajectories.

The form of the new restraint energy is:

                 E   =   Sum_i   KFORCE_i * [RMSD  - OFFSET_i]**2

Where RMSD is the (possibly mass-weighted) root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD)
of the current coordinates with respect to a reference structure, KFORCE_i
is a force constant, and OFFSET_i is a constant value setting a relative
distance with respect to the RMSD of the structure. The restraint energy is
equivalent the normal BestFit energy.  The forces have been checked with the
TEST FIRST command.

All the data structure is stored dynamically on the HEAP and thus, no extra
permanent (static) storage is introduced.  The size of initial HEAP storage
is set by the MAXRmsd integer the first time that the command is issued
(by default this is set to the number of atoms if nothing is specified).

By specifying the RELATIVE keyword, it is possible to impose a 1-D
constraint to simultaneously constrain a given structure with respect to
two end-point structures. This is achieved by constraining the difference
(RMSD2 - RMSD1) instead of just the RMSD1 or RMSD2 values individually, where
RMSD1 and RMSD2 are the RMSD values of given structure from endpoint structure
1 and 2 respectively. This allow full freedom of movements orthogonal to the
relative axis.  For the relative RMSD constraint, the form of the
new restraint energy is:

                 E   =   Sum_i   KFORCE_i * [(RMSD2-RMSD1) - OFFSET_i]**2

The syntax is very similar to all current restraints in CHARMM:

CONS RMSD { RELAtive } {MAXN integer} {NPRT} orient-specs  force-const-spec -
                                      coordinate-spec atom-selection
CONS RMSD  SHOW
CONS RMSD  CLEAR

orient-specs     ::=  [ NOROtation ] [ NOTRanslation ]

force-const-spec ::=  { FORCE real } [MASS]  {OFFSet real} { BOFFset real}

coordinate-spec::= { [MAIN] } 
                   {  COMP  } 

CONS CLEAR 

removes all multiple RMSD restraints

CONS RMSD SHOW

prints all current RMSD restraints with all parameters.

The specific terms are:

RELAtive         -  Employ relative RMSD restraint using two reference 
                    structures as defined above
NPRT             -  This suppresses the printout of the RMSD to URMSD
                    unit in a dynamics simulation.  The default is to print
                    all RMSD.
MAXN             -  Maximum number of RMSD restraints (replaces MAXRMSD
                    used in previous versions) default setting = 10
COMP             -  Use comparison cordinate set as reference 
                    (default uses main).
FORCE <real>     -  Force constant for RMSD term in kcal/mol/A^2
OFFSet <real>    -  RMSD value in A^ at which the structure is restrained
BOFFset <real>   -  offset at which to begin applying the harmonic RMSD 
                    restraint, useful in specifying a flat-bottom RMSD 
                    potential around the reference structure

IMPORTANT NOTES:
1. The MAXRMSD variable specifying total number of restrained atoms used 
before has been replaced by the variable MAXN specifying the number of 
RMSD restraints. This allows dynamic allocation of memory for storing
reference structures during atom selection for the RMSD restraint, which
reduces memory usage significantly
2. The c32 release contained additions including the ZETA potential and
the ability to fit one set of atoms using RMSD and apply the forces to 
another set of atoms. These are not included in the present version due
to their inability to pass TEST FIRST
3.  RMSD restraints can be used with DYNAmics command.
   DYNAmics ... [ RMSD URMSD integer ]  This will cause the RMSD values
for each of the RMSD restraints to be written to the unit specified by URMSD,
unless the NPRT option is pecified when the RMSD restraint is defined.

         THIS COMMAND ADDS A Quadratic POTENTIAL to restrain the
         reaction coordinate. The reaction coordinate is defined
         as a weighted sum of contacts.

                               i
     DIST - distance between centers of geometry of residues 
         i
            forming contact i 
   
  Usage:

  The following examples illustrate the use of this restraint term.
  
  1) Add an distance matrix restraint potential to dynamics run, save 
  trajectory information to unit.  This example applies a distance 
  restraint of the form given above between pairs of side chain 
  centers-of-mass for a set of 54 contacts and restrains the system
  to a fractional value of the overall reaction coordinate of 0.625.
  Each restraint term is given a weight based on the amount of time
  the given contact was formed in the native state simulation.  For
  details of the method used here, the reader is referred to:
  [Sheinerman and Brooks, JMB, 278, 439 (1998).]
