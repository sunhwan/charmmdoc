                          CHARMM Release Package


The CHARMM release package for CHARMM developers and user sites includes

    (1) complete source and include files,
    (2) updated documentation files,
    (3) some supporting data files,
    (4) testcases,
    (5) the PREFX preprocessor and tools needed to set up CHARMM
        development environments and 
    (6) standard topology and parameter files.

    The files are organized in the followoing subdirectories.
~/ denotes the directory where you have unpacked (read from a tape
drive or issued the UNIX tar command) the CHARMM release package
delivered to you.  In ~/cnnXm, nn is the version number, X is the
version trunk designator (a for alpha or developmental, b for beta
release and c for gamma or general release) and m is the revision
number.  For example, c24b1 is CHARMM version 24 beta release revision 1.

                      User Site CHARMM Installation


The installation is carried out by the shell script ~/cnnXm/install.com.
Change your working directory to ~/cnnXm and run install.com.
install.com expects one or more arguments.

  install.com <host_machine_type> [ <CHARMM_size> <install switches> ]

The default and possible arguments are 

  <host_machine_type1> = { alpha, alphamp, cm5, convex, cray, cspp }
                         { dec, gnu, gws, hal, hpux, ibmrs, ibmsp  }
                         { intel, sgi, stardent, sun, t3d, terra   }

  <CHARMM_size>        = { reduced, small, medium, large  | medium }

  <install switches>   = { 1, 2, FULL, LITE, F77, G77, P, M, S, 64 }
                         { Q, C, X, G                              }    

where { | } is for { possible arguments | default }.  <CHARMM_size>
depends on your machine memory configuration.  In general, 'medium' is
recommended.  User site installation can be taylored with the install.com
switches.

      1  to halt after setting up installation directory.
      2  to halt after making installation utilities.
   FULL  For FULL featured version (default).
   LITE  For a version with reduced functional features.
    F77  Uses Absoft/Linux (default: f2c driven by fort77).
    G77  Uses g77/Linux (default: f2c driven by fort77).
      P  links to PVM
      M  links to MPI
      S  Uses TCP/IP SOCKET library for parallel.
     64  to compile in the 64-bit mode on SGI platforms.
      Q  replace QUANTUM with GAMESS.
      C  replace QUANTUM with CADPAC.
      X  for the X-lib graphics to be included.
      G  for the GL-lib graphics to be included.

When one or more install switches are used, <CHARMM_size> must be
specified too.  Note that X and G are mutually exclusive and G
requires the GL library.  P and M are also mutually exclusive.  The
switch 2 can be used to stop installation and modify the pref.dat file
to further customize CHARMM features.

For example, 'install.com sgi'
  1. installs the preprocessor PREFX in ~/cnnXm/tool (prefx_sgi),
  2. generates the proper ~/cnnXm/build/sgi/pref.dat file (PREFX data file),
  3. generates makefile suitable for SGI computers running under IRIX
     (~/cnnXm/build/sgi/Makefile),
  4. processes FORTRAN and C source files, compiles and builds module
     libraries in ~/cnnXm/lib/sgi, and 
  5. links them to produce the executable ~/cnnXm/exec/sgi/charmm.

                          CHARMM Documentation

The CHARMM documentation set is being updated and improved.  The
up-to-the-date documentation set is included in the current release.
The documentation is an integral part of CHARMM.

    The documentation files are accessible through the info program in
GNU emacs.  If emacs is available on your system, you may incorporate
the documentation into the info-tree structure.  The following is the
info-building procedure.

(1) Locate the info directory.  On tammy.harvard.edu, it is 
    /usr/lib/gemacs/info.  It may differ on your machine.
(2) Find the file, dir, in the info directory.  You should have a
    write access of the directory.  If the info directory is protected,
    contact your system manager and let him do the job.  Edit the dir file
    and insert the following one line under "* Menu".

* CHARMM: (chmdoc/charmm.doc). CHARMM Documentation

    It should appear exactly as shown; asterisk (*) in the first
column, etc.  The the part of dir file may look like this.

File: dir       Node: Top       This is the top of the INFO tree

        Quick Key Reference

        d                  return here
        q                  exit
        ?                  list INFO commands
        h                  help
        mCHARMM<return>    go into CHARMM documentation
        1                  go into CHARMM documentation (works for 1..5)
        u                  go up

===========================================================================
* Menu:

* CHARMM: (chmdoc/charmm.doc). CHARMM Documentation
* Emacs: (emacs).              Yours truly
* Info: (info).                This documentation browsing system.

(3) Save the file and exit the editor.  You now have to link the
    CHARMM documentation directory as in the following.

    ln -s ~/cnnXm/doc chmdoc

    Remember that ~/ is the parent directory that holds the charmm
    directory.

                Standard CHARMM Topology and Parameter Files


(A) Topology files
    (1) top_all22_lipid.inp      all hydrogen RTF for lipids
    (2) top_all22_prot.inp       all hydrogen RTF for proteins
    (3) top_all22_na.inp         all hydrogen RTF for nucleic acids
    (4) top_all22_prot_na.inp    all hydrogen RTF for proteins and
                                                      nucleic acids 
    (5) top_all22_model.inp      all hydrogen RTF for protein model cmpds
    (6) toph19.inp               extended atom RTF for proteins
    (7) toprna10r_22.inp         extended atom RTF for nucleic acids

(B) Parameter files
    (1) par_all22_lipid.inp      all hydrogen parameters for lipids
    (2) par_all22_prot.inp       all hydrogen parameters for proteins
    (3) par_all22_na.inp         all hydrogen parameters for nucleic acids
    (5) par_all22_prot_na.inp    all hydrogen parameters for proteins and
                                                             nucleic acids 
    (6) param19.inp              extended atom parameters for proteins
    (7) pardna10_22.inp          extended atom parameters for nucleic acids

    The CHARMM22 all-hydrogen topology and parameter sets may be
considered to be stable, however, further changes cannot be excluded.
The bulk of the changes are expected to be additions leading to an
expanding set of parameters which are compatible across proteins,
nucleic acids, lipids, and, ultimately, carbohydrates.  The
carbohydrate parameter work is still in progress by John Brady and
coworkers.  See the file toppar_all.history for a listing changes in
the files over time.  top_all22_model.inp includes the majority of
model compounds used in the protein parameterization and is to be used
in conjunction with par_all22_prot.inp.  top_all22_prot_na.inp and
par_all22_prot_na.inp contain both the protein and nucleic acid
parameters allowing for calculations on protein-nucleic acid
complexes.  The lipid parameters may be combined in a similar fashion,
although it hasn't been performed at present.  The extended atom
parameters for proteins are the same as those included with CHARMM20
which are based on Wally Reiher's thesis.  For the extended atom
nucleic acid parameters those of Nilsson and Karplus, J. Comp.  Chem.
7:591-616, 1986 are used which were also included in the CHARMM20
release and are the only set to include explicit hydrogen bonding
terms.  Some alterations of the extended atom nucleic acid topology
and parameter files have been made in order to maintain compatibility
with the multiple dihedral scheme in CHARMM22.  Please send all
remarks and suggestions to alex@mmiris.ab.umd.edu. ADM Jr., July, 1995
