Background:

    The GBMV module is a Generalized Born method for 
mimicking the Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) electrostatic solvation energy. The PB
method for obtaining solvation energies is considered a benchmark for implicit 
solvation calculations. However, the PB method is slow and the derivatives, 
i.e. forces, are ill-defined unless one changes the definition of the 
molecular volume.
     The Generalized Born equation, as prescribed by Still, et. al. allows
one to compute solvation energies very similar to the PB equations. 
As it is an analytical expression, forces are available as well:

                                                     q q
                              N   N                   i j
    G   =  -C  (1-1/eps){1/2 sum sum ------------------------------------ }
     pol     el              i=1 j=1 [r^2 + alpha *alpha exp(-D  )]^(0.5)
                                       ij        i      j      ij

           
    D   = r^2 / (K_s * alpha * alpha )
     ij    ij               i       j

where K_s = 4 for Still's original equation, or 8 for modified equation.
     The only problem is that one needs to calculate the alpha's, a.k.a.
Born radii for each atom, accurately. There are various methods available, 
such as the GBORN, ACE, and GBSW modules in CHARMM. 
     The GBMV method obtains the Born radii very accurately, 
i.e, w/ greater than 0.99 correlation. It is available as three approaches:

 1)  grid-based (Most accurate)
 2)  analytical method I (Least accurate, fastest)
 2)  analytical method II (preferred for dynamics)

The analytical method has derivatives and thus can be used in molecular 
dynamics simulations. The grid-based method has no derivatives, however, 
it is the most accurate and still can be used in energy ranking and 
Monte-Carlo methods.

When should you use GBMV?

     Because the analytical and grid-based methods are quite accurate, the
parameters change very little when optimized for a particular force-field. 
Hence, forcefields besides those of CHARMM can be used with GBMV without 
refitting of parameters. The GBMV method II approximates the molecular
surface directly. The agreement with respect to electrostatic solvation 
energies from standard Poisson theory is very good (<1% relative error). 
The higher accuracy comes at a price, however, and GBMV is slower than 
other GB methods in CHARMM.

Surface Area

     A solvent accessible surface area (SASA) calculation is implemented
within the GB module. There is essentially no additional cost compared to the 
GB calculation itself and about 5 times faster than an exact, analytical 
calculation (e.g. from the ASP module). It is accurate to within 1% of the 
exact surface and is much more accurate than the SASA module within CHARMM.

CORR      Coloumb field correction method: 

            0  for R^5 method.            use: SHIFT/ESHIFT/TT

               alpha(i) = - 1/( r4 - TT * r5 + ESHIFT ) + SHIFT

            1  for R^7 method (default)   use: SHIFT/SLOPE

	       alpha(i) = SLOPE/( A1 * r4 + A2 * r5 + A3 * r7 + ESHIFT) + SHIFT

               this mode is intended for the calculation of Born radii
               in different dielectric environments

            3  for R^5/R^7                use: A1/A3/A4/A5/SLOPE

	       alpha(i) = SLOPE/( A1 * r4 + A3(i) * r7) + A4 + A5/(eps(i) + 1)
               A3(i)    = A3 * 3 * eps(i) / (3 * eps(i) + 2 * EPS)

               this mode is intended for the implicit membrane model(see below)

            4  Same as CORR = 3 except that the local dielectric constant
               is modulated spherically.

            5  Same as CORR = 3 except that the local dielectric constant

          where r4 is volume integral over 1/r^4, r5 is square root
          of integral over 1/r^5 and r7 is integral over 1/r^7 to the 
          power of 1/4.

A1,A2, A3 Multiplicative factors in calculation of Alpha(i). 

WATR      The radius of the water probe. Usually this is set to 1.4 
          Angstroms. If this were changed, other parameters would have 
          to be modified.

EPSILON   This is the value of the dielectric constant for the solvent medium.

          is 0 (no salt).

GEOM      Select geometric cross-term in Still equation (default).

ARITH     Select arithmetic cross-term in Still equation.

P6        Exponent in exponential of Still equation. Default is 4, for
          historical reasons. Value of 8 is RECOMMENDED for GEOM, 6.5 for
          ARITH.
 
WEIGHT    Use WMAIN array for radii. (Default uses vdW radii array)

CLEAr     Clear all arrays and logical flags used in Generalized Born 
          calculation. Use command by itself.

          -----------------------------------------------------------
          Parameters specific to GBMV I and II:
          -----------------------------------------------------------

FIXA      Update alphas only if coordinates have changed more
          than expected for finite differences. Useful for
          static pka calculations. With FIXA keyword, finite-difference
          wouldn't work correctly, hence it must be specified. Not
          on by default. 

ALFRQ     Update frequency of Born radii. Use with great caution! 
          One of LIMP,IMP, or EMP options must be selected. (Default 1)
	  Values other 1 not generally recommended.

LIMP      Use ALFRQ*(dE/dalpha)(dalpha/dx) part of GB force every ALFRQ
          steps. For ALFRQ <= 5.

EMP       Decay constant of the impulse force. Default is 1.5, which
          is meant for ALFRQ of 5. Generally, EMP ~= ALFRQ/4. For 
          ALFRQ <= 10. (Recommended option)

IMP       Use (dE/dalpha)(dalpha/dx) part of GB force every ALFRQ
          steps. Any ALFRQ can be used. Only meant for equilibrium
          calculations.

DN        The cell width of the lookup grid. Larger values make program
          slower. Smaller values use up more memory. Default of 1.0 A is best
          compromise between speed and memory.

BETA      Smoothing factor for tailing off of volume. 
          Values of around -100 are fine for GBMV I. Values between -8 to 
          -50 are reasonable for GBMV II. (Default -20)

	  Smaller values of beta lead to more stable dynamics, but compromise
          the agreement with Poisson theory. In GBMV II the choice of BETA 
          also affects P3. Good pairs of values for GBMV II are:

             BETA = -20, P3 = 0.70
             BETA = -12, P3 = 0.65  * recommended as best compromise
             BETA = -10, P3 = 0.57
             BETA =  -8, P3 = 0.35

LAMBda    The threshold value for the atomic volumes. In GBMV I, smaller
          values produces shorter Born radii and wide variance w/respect
          to accurate PB radii. Large values produce larger radii but smaller 
          variance. In GBMV II, value should be kept at 0.5.

BUFR      Distance that any atom is allowed to move before lookup table
          is rebuilt. Larger values lead to less lookup table update but larger
          memory usage. Use 0.0 for static structure.
          Values between 0.2 and 1.0 Angstrom. (Default 0.5)

MEM       Percentage extra memory beyond hypothetical calculation of table
          size. (Default 10)

TOL       Accuracy of the switching function used to determine accuracy of the
          first derivatives, i.e. forces. (Default 1e-8)

SA        Surface area coefficient (KCAL/(MOL*A**2)). (Default 0.0)
          SASA Energy term shows up under EXTERN/ASP.

SB        Surface area constant (KCAL/MOL) (no effect on forces) (Default 0.0)

SON       The startpoint for the switching function of each hard sphere.
          (Default 1.2) Units in Angstroms

SOFF      The endpoint for the switching function of each hard sphere.
          (Default 1.5)

P1        The multiplicative factor for the exponent of the 
          quartic exponential atomic function:
                
                 Gamma(i) = P1 * log(lambda)/(Rad(i)^4)

          Parameters specific to GBMV II:

P1,P2     Variables which affect the shape of the VSA atomic function in the 
          region of R to R+2. 
 
                 F(x) = A^2 / (A + x^2 - R^2)^2

             where

                 A = P1 * R + P2 (Defaults: P1 = 1.25/P2 = 0.45)

P3        Scaling factor of VSA function. Default = 0.7 
          This factor depends on the value chosen for BETA 
          (see description above)

P4        Scaling coefficient for correction term to Still's equation.
          (set to 0.0 for now)

P5        Exponent to the Still correction term. (use default for now)

HSX1/HSX2 Start and stop of hard-sphere tail with R(vdW) as origin.
          (Defaults: -0.125/0.25).

ONX/OFFX  Start and stop of VSA tail. Increasing values up to 2.8 A 
          makes better accuracy, however slows calculation. Compromise
          of 1.9/2.1 is default.

FAST      Turns on fast GBMV routine.

SGBFRQ    Update frequency of internal lookup list in fast GBMV mode 
          (Default 1). Values between 1 and 10 are recommended.

SXD       Delta used in fast GBMV mode lookup buffer. (Default 0). 
          Recommended values between 0.1 and 0.5. Requires 'FAST 1'

GBVDW     If present, the VDW dispersion term is turned on.

          -----------------------------------------------------------

UNEPS     Unit number of an input file holding the delectric profile
          values (Use -1 for the default profile).  The format of this
          input file is restricted.  Comments are not allowed in a file.
          The dielectric profile must be sampled in equal intervals.
          The first line needs the number of sampling points n and the
          sampling interval h (Angstrom). Two columns of the z coordinates
          (Angstrom) and dielectric constants. The example is given 
          in test/data/hdgb_eps.dat.
  
A4,A5     Parameters in calculation of Alpha(i). A4 and A5 correspond
          to the parameter D and E of Equation (15) in the reference (3)
          respectively. 


ZS,ZM,ZT  Parameters for a switching function for the nonpolar energy.
ST0       ZS, ZM, ZT, and ST0 corresponds to Za, Zb, Zc, and C of
          Equation (11) in the reference (4).

          upon insertion to an implicit membrane.
          (Only availabe for CORR = 3)

                  Usage Examples and Compatibility


The examples below illustrate some of the uses of the generalized Born
Molecular Volume (GBMV) module.  See c29test/gbmvtest.inp for more examples.

--------------------------------------
THERE ARE TWO REQUIREMENTS TO RUN GBMV
--------------------------------------
1) Coordinates MUST be defined for all atoms before invoking the GBMV keyword.
   Otherwise, "infinite" grid is established which uses too much memory.

2) CUTOFF Parameters MUST be defined. 
   For non-infinite cutoffs, "switch" in nonbonded parameters is NECESSARY.
