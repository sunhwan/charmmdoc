                 Self-Guided Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) simulation

                      By Xiongwu Wu and Bernard R. Brooks


     A SGLD simulation enhances conformational search efficiency through
acceleration of systematic motions in a molecular system.  The systematic 
motion represents the slow conformational change that contributes the most 
in conformational search.  A guiding force in the direction of the systematic
motion, which is calculated as a local average of velocities, is introduced 
into the equation of motion to enhance the systematic motion.  It has been
demonstrated that within the suggested parameter range, a SGLD simulation 
has a dramatically enhanced conformational search efficiency while has little
perturbation on conformational distribution.  More details are described in 
the paper: 
     "Self-guided Langevin dynamcs simulation method", Chem. Phys. Letter, 
381, 512-518(2003).

     The SGLD algorithm is developed based on a previously developed 
self-guided molecular dynamics simulation method, which employs a local 
average of nonbonded interaction forces as the guiding force.  The 
force-based guiding force correlates with the energy surface that may 
change the conformational distribution.  The SGLD method uses a local 
average of velocities to calculate the guiding force, and overcomes the
disadvantage of the old method.  When SGLD is used without friction, we 
refer to this method as SGMD.  Please be not confused with the 
force-based self-guided molecular dynamics method.

     Two parameters, the guiding factor, SGFT, and the local average time,
TSGAVG, define the guiding effect in a SGLD simulation. A larger TSGAVG will
result in a slower motion to be enhanced.  A larger SGFT will introduce 
stronger guiding forces and result in a larger energy barrier overcoming
ability.  When SGFT=0, a SGMD/SGLD simulaiton reduces to a normal MD/LD
simiulation.  SGFT should be limited to keep systematic motion very small 
as compared with thermo-motions like vibration, so that all degrees of 
freedom retain their kinetic energies.  

     To avoid the difficulty in chosing the value of SGFT, a parameter 
called guiding temperature (TEMPSG) is introduced. TEMPSG set the 
perturbation limit that a guiding force may cause to a simulation system.  
The guiding force will cause less perturbation than rising the temperature 
by TEMPSG degrees.  Normally, TEMPSG=1 K can provide significant enhancement 
in conformational search, while cause a perturbation less than rising the
temperature by 1 degree. A larger TEMPSG results in more accelaration in 
slow motion.  When TEMPSG=0, a constant guiding factor, SGFT, will apply.
When TEMPSG>0, the guiding factors are calculated according to TEMPSG during
a SGMD/SGLD simulation.  A user can monitor the instant SGFT and TEMPSG in
CHARMM output by setting PRNLEV>4.

Keyword  Default  Purpose

SGLD     false    Turn on SGLD simulation (for Langevin dynamics, LANG). 
                  Friction constants, FBETA, must be set at first.

SGMD     false    Turn on SGMD simulation (for MD simulations)

TSGAVG   0.2 ps   Local average time. A larger TSGAVG will result in slower 
                  motion to be enhanced. All motions with periods larger than
		  TSGAVG will be enhanced.

TSGAVP   10 ps    Guiding effect average time. This time is used to calculate
                  averages to estimate SGFT from TEMPSG. A larger TSGAVP will
		  result in a slower flucturation of SGFT.

TEMPSG   1.0 K    Guiding temperature. TEMPSG>0 will override SGFT.  TEMPSG
                  set the perturbation limit a guiding force may cause to a
		  simulation system.  The guiding force will cause less
		  perturbation than rising the temperature by TEMPSG degrees.
		  Normally, TEMPSG=1 K can provide significant enhancement in
		  conformational search, while cause a perturbation less than
		  rising the temperature by 1 degree. A larger TEMPSG results 
		  in more accelaration in slow motion.  When TEMPSG is set, 
		  the guiding factors, SGFT, are calculated accordingly in a
		  SGMD/SGLD simulation. 

SGFT     0.0      Guiding factor. When TEMPSG=0,  SGFT will be 
                  constant throughout a simulation. When TEMPSG>0, 
                  SGFT fluctuates during the simulation to maintain a guiding
                  temperature of TEMPSG. If a constant SGFT simulation is
                  desired, one can read the approximate values of SGFT from
                  the output of a SGLD simulation with TEMPSG=1K.

SGMV     false    Allow guiding force on the center of mass

ISGSTA   1        The index of the first atom of the region to apply the 
                  guiding force

ISGEND   natom    The index of the last atom of the region to apply the 
                  guiding force
