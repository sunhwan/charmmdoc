The Reactive Molecular Dynamics (RMD) method allows to simulate
dynamics using two potential energy surfaces provided by the user, such that 
the dynamics always takes place on the lowest surface. Crossings are detected
automatically and occur by a smooth switching centered in time around which 
the crossing was detected. The current implementation assumes 
that the long-range interactions are handled with the SHIFT command 
for electrostatics and the SWITCH for the Lennard-Jones potential. To include 
RMD in the compilation, the flag RMD should be included in pref.dat

          Syntax for the Reactive Molecular Dynamics commands


RXMD   SHIF real  UPAR integer [ XTIM integer ] [ UNIT integer ] - 
                                [ FREQ integer ] [ BTOL real ]


SHIF    4.0    Constant Offset between the two potential energy surfaces.
               It is highly recommended to always set this parameter.

UPAR    Int    Unit containing the parameters for the two surfaces.
               This unit must be open (FORMatted) for reading when RXMD
               is called.

XTIM     10    Sets the number of timesteps during which the smooth 
               switching between the two surfaces takes place around a
               crossing.

UNIT     -1    Unit to which a coordinate dump (in PDB format) will occur  
               at the crossing point.  

FREQ      1    Frequency (in time-steps) at which RXMD tries to detect a 
               crossing

BTOL   0.0001  Threshold that allows events where the potential energies come 
               close (but not quite cross) to induce surface switching.

        Description of the Reaction Molecular Dynamics command

To invoke RMD, the CROS command should be given before the 
DYNAmics command. At the point where RXMD is called, it is important
that the crossing parameter file is opened on the unit UPAR as FORMATTED.
It is also recommended to proceed the RXMD command with an UPDAte so
that bonded parameter lists are up-to-date. 

Energy terms present in both the PSF and the crossing parameter file, will 
have the term removed and replaced with that defined in the parameter file.
In this sense, the CROSS module can be used to introduce specific parameters
in the reactive center, or replace a harmonic bond with an anharmonic one, etc.

It is possible to do minimizations on the potential energy surfaces defined in
the crossing parameter file via the RXMD command. During the minimization, the
switching function is turned off so that the minimal surface is followed in 
each step. 

A typical input sequence for a RXMD simulation is as follows 

OPEN UNIT 9 READ FORMATTED NAME cross.dat

UPDATE
RXMD SHIF 10.0  UPAR 9 XTIM 10 UNIT 14

OPEN UNIT 14 WRITe FORMatted NAME crossing.pdb

OPEN UNIT 11 READ FORMatted NAME old.res
OPEN UNIT 12 WRITe FORMatted NAME new.res
OPEN UNIT 13 WRITe UNFORMatted NAME  cross_traj.dcd
DYNAmics LEAPfrog VERLET RESTart - 
...

In the first step, RXMD will detect which potential energy surface is
lower and initiate the dynamics on that. The output from a 
RXMD simulation is the same as that from a standard dynamics run, with
the addition of the timepoints of the detected crossings 
(and the structure at the crossing dumped in UNIT in PDB format). If IPRINT 
is > 5, additional detailed information about added and removed energy 
terms and the energy difference between the potential energy surfaces are 
printed. The crossing procedure uses an energy term called RXMD that can be 
bypassed by the SKIPE command. The removal of other energy terms with SKIPE
will also remove the corresponding energy terms in the user-defined PES in a
consistent way.

For the Electrostatics, any method can be used, but the energy difference
between the two surfaces is always calculated with the SHIFTed cut-off
method for the electrostatics, and will therefore not be consistent if
any other method used for the total energy and forces.

The use of the RXMD module together with any procedure that modifies the
PSF is for the moment not supported, since the method assumes the PSF to be 
kept as it is defined at the moment the RXMD command is given.

The user has to provide an extra parameter file to describe the two
potential energy surfaces involved in the crossing. The format should look
like:

ATOM nr_of_atoms (int)
atom1 q1_1 sigma1_1 epsilon1_1 q1_2 sigma1_2 epsilon1_2 (int,real*6)
atom2 q2_1 ...
...
BOND nr_of_harmonic_bonds (int)
atom1a atom1b k1_1 r1_1 k1_2 r1_2 (int*2,real*4)
atom2a atom2b k2_1 ...
...
MORS nr_of_morse_bonds (int)
atom1a atom1b d1_1 r1_1 b1_1 d1_2 r1_2 b1_2 (int*2,real*6)
atom2a atom2b d2_1 r2_1 ...
...
ANGL nr_of_angles (int)
atom1a atom1b atom1c k1_1 t1_1 k1_2 t1_2 (int*3,real*4)
atom2a ...
...
DIHE nr_of_dihedrals (int)
atom1a atom1b atom1c atom1d k1_1 m1_1 p1_1 k1_2 m1_2 p1_2 (int*4,real,int,
real*2,int,real)
...

Symbols:
q - partial charge
sigma,epsilon - vdw parameters
k - force constant
r - equilibrium bond length
d - dissociation energy
b - beta parameter in Morse potential
t - equilibrium angle
m - dihedral multiplicity
p - phase angle

_y means that this parameter should be used on surface y, so q1_2 means the
partial charge of atom 1 on surface 2, and m3_1 means the dihedral 
multiplicity of dihedral 3 on surface 1.

All forcefield terms that differ between the two states or from the PSF 
should be defined. If a term is absent in one of the states
the corresponding force constant should be given a negative 
value. For dihedrals, a multiplicity of 0 indicates an improper dihedral.

Note that all blocks must be present, even if no new energy term
of that kind is defined. For example, even if no new dihedrals are defined,
the file should still has a line reading 'DIHE 0'. There should be no comments
or empty lines in this file.

An example of the parameter input file is given below, for a NO molecule
with and without a bond to a heme group. (94 and 95 is the NO ligand, 21 the
heme iron, 22-25 the pyrrole nitrogen, and 15 the nitrogen of the histidine
coordinating on the opposite side)
