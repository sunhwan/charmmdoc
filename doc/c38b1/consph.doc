     The constant pH code is designed to allow the running of a molecular
dynamics simulation with a fixed pH. What this means is that titratable
groups can protonate and deprotonate over the course of the simulation in
a manner dictated by the specified pH value. In order to accomplish this, the
dynamics simulation is periodically interrupted (the frequency can be
determined by the user), and at least one Monte Carlo trial is run that
attempts to change the protonation state of one of the titratable
residues. In this implementation, the user must indicate to CHARMM which
residues may have their protonation state change, which allows for
completely flexibility (e.g. if it is known that a particular residue
never changes its protonation state). This is done via the CNSPh
command (see below).

     The code has been tested with standard MD and Langevin dynamics
using the LEAPfrog and VVER integrators. Other integrators have not 
been tested, but should work. It is compatible with the existing 
CPT code in CHARMM, but image support has not been tested and may 
have issues. We have tested with the GBSW and GBMV implicit solvent 
methods.  The implementation has been parallelized.

     In order to use this code, CHARMM must be compiled with the
"CONSPH" key word in pref.dat. If the "REPDSTR" key word is also used,
then code allowing for replica exchange in pH space will also be
compiled (see repdstr.doc for further details). The constant pH Monte
Carlo procedure will *not* be applied on time steps where a pH replica
exchange occurs.

Command syntax:

I/O:

READ CPH CARD UNIT <int> ! Read constant pH parameter file.

Defining titratable groups:

CNSPh {ADD   [atom-selection]}
      {DEL   [atom-selection]}
      {CLEAr                 }

ADD   -- Any residue returned by the selection is added to the list
         of titratable residues.
DEL   -- Any residue returned by the selection is removed from the
         list of titratable residues, if present.
CLEAr -- The list of titratable residues is emptied.

Running dynamics with constant pH:

DYNAmics ... PHCONS consph-spec

consph-spec::= PHEXCF <int> PHMCTR <int> [PHUNUM <int>] PHVAL <real>
               [ IUNPHR <int> ] [ IUNPHw <int> ] [ PHTEMP <real> ]

keyword       explanation
-------       -----------

PHEXCF        Frequency at which to attempt to change the titration state
              of the system. Every PHEXCF steps, the dynamics will be
              interrupted and the monte carlo procedure run.

PHMCTR        The number of Monte Carlo trials to run. As of the current
              implementation, the code picks a random residue of those
              marked titratable to modify at each step.

PHUNUM        The unit to write the current state of the system to at 
              each step. The syntax of the resulting file is given below.
              The default is to not write any file.

PHVAL         The pH value at which the simulation is performed.

PHTEMP        Temperature to use in the pH exchange equation. If left
              unset or if the value given is less than 0, the instantaneous
              temperature of the system is used.

IUNPHR        Unit to read a restart file from for use with constant pH (NB
              the restart file for constant pH is kept separately from the
              dynamics restart file).

IUNPHw        Unit to write a restart file to for use with constant pH.

Parameter file syntax:

The Constant pH parameter file follows regular CHARMM syntax conventions
(i.e. it must start with a title, and comment lines must begin with an
exclamation mark). Within the parameter file, the possibly titration
states of various individual residues may be defined. The syntax for 
defining a titratable residue is:

RESI <resname> <nstate> ! nstate is the number of possible titration states.
RFPK <float> [<float>] ! reference pKa, of model compound
RFDG <float> [<float>] ! See notes section.
ATOM <type>  <charge at state 1> <charge at state 2> [<charge at state 3>]
.
.
.

The file must end with "END" on a line by itself.

The parameter file containing the values used in the reference work may be
found in the support/parameters directory of the CHARMM distribution. Its name is
ph_param.prm.

In the current implementation, each titratable residue can have at most
three different protonation states, of which only one is considered
"protonated." This is to accommodate Histidine, which has two different
deprotonated states. The first state listed in the parameter file should
be the fully protonated state (this is not enforced by the code, but is
how the equations are written).

The format of the PHUNUM state file is as follows for a system with N
titratable groups:

<timestep>:   <group 1 start>-><group 1 end> ... <group N start>-><group N end>

At each timestep where a pH Monte Carlo trial is done, a new line is
appended to the file showing the starting and ending state of each titratable
group, separated by "->". The states are numbered, from one, in the order
that they appear in the parameter file. The residues appear in numerical
order (i.e. the first titratable residue by number will appear first, etc.).
Note that if a Monte Carlo trial is skipped at a particular time step due
to the use of pH replica exchange, no corresponding line will be added
to the PHUNUM file.

In order to protonate or deprotonate a residue, the charges on the
individual atoms are changed according to the charge values given in
the constant pH parameter file. Currently, no parameters other than the
charges are modified. Future work will expand this scheme to also modify
the van der Waal radii. Because of the way that this is implemented,
it is important that the PSF contain entries for all atoms. For this
reason, we suggest starting each simulation with all residues whose
titrations may change fully protonated.

Creating constant pH parameters:

The syntax of the parameter file is described above. Residues may
have two states or three states. If there are three states, only
the first one can be considered protonated; the other two are deprotonated.
If there are three states then two RFPK and RFDG values must be given.

The RFPK value(s) correspond to pKa,w and the RFDG value(s) correspond 
to delta(Fele,w) in equation 1 of Itoh et al. (see reference). The
latter is the electrostatic component of the free energy differences
between the protonated and deprotonated states of the model compound.
This value can be obtained from free energy perturbation simulations 
(see pert.doc for details) or by running pH replica exchange at 
different values until thew correct titration curve is achieved.
