The Reactive Molecular Dynamics (RMD) method allows to simulate
dynamics using multiple potential energy surfaces provided by the user, such 
that the dynamics always takes place on the lowest surface. Crossings are 
detected automatically and occur by a smooth switching centered in time around 
which the crossing was detected. The current implementation assumes 
that the long-range interactions are handled with the SHIFT command 
for electrostatics and the SWITCH for the Lennard-Jones potential. To include 
RMD in the compilation, the flag RMD should be included in pref.dat

          Syntax for the Reactive Molecular Dynamics commands


RXMD   UPAR integer [ XTIM integer ] [ UNIT integer ] [ FREQ integer ] - 
                    [ BCHK real ] [ BVDW ]


UPAR    Int    Unit containing the parameters for the two surfaces.
               This unit must be open (FORMatted) for reading when RXMD
               is called.

XTIM     10    Sets the number of timesteps during which the smooth 
               switching between the two surfaces takes place around a
               crossing.

UNIT     -1    Unit to which a coordinate dump (in PDB format) will occur  
               at the crossing point.  

FREQ      1    Frequency (in time-steps) at which RXMD print out the energy  
               difference between the currently active surface and the surface 
               which comes closest to a crossing.

BCHK     -1    Cutoff distance for energy comparison checks for surfaces
               including a dissociated bond on the current surface which is
               present on another one. If the distance between the bonding 
               atoms is larger than this value the energy between those
               surfaces is not compared at all. Inactive for negative values.

BVDW           Activates special Lennard-Jones potential for the Van-der 
               Waals interactions between dissociated bonds. This interaction 
               replaces the standard Van-der Waals interaction coming from
               the ATOM section in the surface crossing parameter file or 
               the standard CHARMM Van-der Waals interaction as defined by 
               the CHARMM parameter file. It is only considered for the 1-2
               (possible bonding atom partners) and 1-3 interactions (related
               angles which must be listed in the ANGL section). The 
               description of individual Van-der Waals parameters (epsilon &
               sigma) for every broken bond is described below.

        Description of the Reactive Molecular Dynamics command

To invoke RMD, the CROS command should be given before the 
DYNAmics command. At the point where RXMD is called, it is important
that the crossing parameter file is opened on the unit UPAR as FORMATTED.
It is also recommended to proceed the RXMD command with an UPDAte so
that bonded parameter lists are up-to-date. 

Energy terms present in both the PSF and the crossing parameter file, will 
have the term removed and replaced with that defined in the parameter file.
In this sense, the CROSS module can be used to introduce specific parameters
in the reactive center, or replace a harmonic bond with an anharmonic one, etc.

It is possible to do minimizations on the potential energy surfaces defined in
the crossing parameter file via the RXMD command. During the minimization, the
switching function is turned off so that the minimal surface is followed in 
each step. 

A typical input sequence for a RXMD simulation is as follows 

OPEN UNIT 9 READ FORMATTED NAME cross.dat

UPDATE
RXMD UPAR 9 XTIM 10 UNIT 14

OPEN UNIT 14 WRITe FORMatted NAME crossing.pdb

OPEN UNIT 11 READ FORMatted NAME old.res
OPEN UNIT 12 WRITe FORMatted NAME new.res
OPEN UNIT 13 WRITe UNFORMatted NAME  cross_traj.dcd
DYNAmics LEAPfrog VERLET RESTart - 
...

In the first step, RXMD will detect which potential energy surface is
lower and initiate the dynamics on that. The output from a 
RXMD simulation is the same as that from a standard dynamics run, with
the addition of the timepoints of the detected crossings 
(and the structure at the crossing dumped in UNIT in PDB format). If IPRINT 
is > 5, additional detailed information about added and removed energy 
terms and the energy difference between the potential energy surfaces are 
printed. The crossing procedure uses an energy term called RXMD that can be 
bypassed by the SKIPE command. The removal of other energy terms with SKIPE
will also remove the corresponding energy terms in the user-defined PES in a
consistent way.

For the Electrostatics, any method can be used, but the energy difference
between the two surfaces is always calculated with the SHIFTed cut-off
method for the electrostatics, and will therefore not be consistent if
any other method used for the total energy and forces.

The use of the RXMD module together with any procedure that modifies the
PSF is for the moment not supported, since the method assumes the PSF to be 
kept as it is defined at the moment the RXMD command is given.  

A detailed list of nonbonding interactions which are removed (exclusions) or 
introduced (inclusions) relatively to the preloaded PSF bond definitions for
every defined ARMD surface is printed if PRNLEV is set to 6 before of the RXMD 
command is called. It is recommended to check this list and compare it to the 
PSF definition when setting up a new ARMD system to avoid possible 
misinterpretations of the ARMD algorithm.

The user has to provide an extra parameter file to describe the two
potential energy surfaces involved in the crossing. The format should look
like:

Symbols:
delta - potential energy shift between any surface > 1 and surface 1
btol - energy tolerance for surface switching (Default: 0.0001 kcal/mol)
q - partial charge
sigma,epsilon - vdw parameters
k - force constant
r - equilibrium bond length
d - dissociation energy
b - beta parameter in Morse potential
t - equilibrium angle
m - dihedral multiplicity
p - phase angle
totsig,toteps - combined vdw parameters for atom_a and atom_b 

_y means that this parameter should be used on surface y, so q1_2 means the
partial charge of atom 1 on surface 2, and m3_1 means the dihedral 
multiplicity of dihedral 3 on surface 1.

All forcefield terms that differ between any of the states or from the PSF 
should be defined. If a term is absent in one of the states
the corresponding force constant (BOND, ANGL, DIHE) or dissociation energy 
(MORS) should be given a negative value. For dihedrals, a multiplicity of 0 
indicates an improper dihedral.

Note that all blocks must be present (expect of BART which is optional), 
even if no new energy term of that kind is defined. For example, even if no 
new dihedrals are defined, the file should still has a line reading 
'DIHE 0'. There should be no comments or empty lines in this file.

The BART section defines an additional list of energy thresholds that allows 
events where the potential energies come close (but not quite cross) to 
induce surface switching. If this section is missing every btol defaults to 
10e-4 kcal/mol.

The usage the optional BVDW section is described in more detail below.

An example of the parameter input file is given below, for a NO molecule
with and without a bond to a heme group. (94 and 95 is the NO ligand, 21 the
heme iron, 22-25 the pyrrole nitrogen, and 15 the nitrogen of the histidine
coordinating on the opposite side)

To prevent clashes between different tertiary structure elements, the 
standard CHARMM forcefield generally sets the VdW parameters epsilon and 
sigma to unnaturally large values. To obtain reasonable transition 
barriers for a bond formation reaction, these parameters need to be 
scaled down for the specific atom pairs and preferentially also between
atom pairs in a 1-3 distance defining an angle (ANGL) over the bond which 
is described by this atom pair. 

The BVDW option gives the user the option to define individual parameters
for epsilon and sigma of the VdW interaction between an atom pair 
describing a bond or its 1-3 interactions which need to be
listed in the BOND, MORS or ANGL section of the parameter file. Furthermore
the corresponding bond or angle interaction must be deactivated on at least
one of the defined surfaces. Additionally, the exponents of the 
Lennard-Jones 12-6 potential as defined in the CHARMM force field must be 
redefined for each of this specific VdW interactions which allows for the 
application other functional forms. If BVDW was requested, epsilon, sigma 
and the repulsive and attractive Lennard-Jones exponents for any broken 
bond or angle defined by two atoms are read from the BVDW section in the 
RMD parameter file.

An adapted example for the parameter input file making use of the BVDW
option is given below. The Morse potential describing a bond between atoms
21 and 94 on surface 2 is deactivated on surface 1. For the VdW 
interactions acting in this state between the two atoms and the atom pairs 
located in a 1-3 distance around them (identified by force constants 
k of -1.0 in the ANGL section) specific parameters are added after the 
DIHE section.
