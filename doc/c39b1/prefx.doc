                          CHARMM Preprocessing

      There is a CHARMM preprocessor, PREFX (formerly PREFLX), which
reads source files as input and produces fortran files for subsequent
compilation.  The main purpose of this preprocessor is to allow a single
version of the source code to work with all platforms and compile options.
A summary of preflx capabilities:
      1.  Allows selective compile of machine specific code
      2.  Allows selected features to be not compiled (to reduce memory needs)
      3.  Supports a size directive to allow larger (and smaller) versions.
      4.  Handles the inclusion of .fcm files in a general manner
      5.  Allows alternate include file directory to be specified
      6.  Allows code expansion for alternate compiles
          (can move IFs from a DO loop).
      7.  Allows comments on source lines following a "!"
      8.  Handles the conversion to single precision (CRAY, DEC alpha,...)
      9.  Identifies unwanted tabs in the source code
      10. Checks for line lengths exceeding 72 for non-comments
      11. Allows processing multiple files from a list (Macintosh version).
      12. Allows the removal of "IMPLICIT NONE" from source files.

NOTE: We are transitioning to use of the C-preprocessor (cpp) and the use of the ##IF
      syntax is being phased out. At present we still make a pass through the prefx
      preprocessor, however, its time is limited. At present it is only recommended for
      implementation of the ##EXPAND constructs if they cannot be done with standard cpp
      define macros. In the revised document below we add the corresponding cpp equivalent
      constructs which represent the current CHARMM standard. A good reference for the use
      of cpp can be found at http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/. Finally, we note that
      we are not "endorsing" the full use of cpp functionality since this can lead to
      code that is highly obfuscated. The current recommendation is to utilize it primarily
      for those functions that are equivalent to the same functionality in the prefx preprocessor.

The source files have the extension ".src".
These files are processed by the preprocessor (PREFX)

SELECTIVE COMPILATION

Conditional compilation is controlled by simple directives.  The directives
all start with "##" in the first column.  Global keywords should be in upper
case and have multiple letters (local keywords use single character or lower
case).  ##IF constructs can be nested (up to 40 levels).

     ##IF keyword(s)     (match-token) ! process code if any keyword is active.
     #if KEY_KEYWORD_1 == 1 || KEY_KEYWORD_2 == 1 /* cpp equivalent, process code if KEYWORD_1 or KEYWORD_2 active */
     ##ELIF keyword(s)   (match-token) ! after and IF or IFN,
                                         alternate processing.
     #elif KEY_KEYWORD == 1            /* cpp equivalent */
     ##ELSE              (match-token) ! after and IF, ELIF, or IFN, process the rest.
     #else                             /* cpp equivalent */
     ##ERROR 'message'                 ! indicates an error within a
                                       ! ##IF construct
                                       ! (usually after a ##ELSE condition).
                                       ! Note: single quotes are required.
     #error                            /* cpp equivalent */
     ##ENDIF             (match-token) ! terminates IF, IFN, ELSE, or ELIF constructs.
     #endif                            /* cpp equivalent */
     ##IFN keyword(s)    (match-token) ! process code if no keyword is active.
     #if KEY_KEYWORD != 1              /* cpp equivalent */


     keywords:: A set of one or more keyword that may be specified in pref.dat
                or in an ##EXPAND construct (see below).

     match-token :: unique text string in parentheses; must be the
                    same for each use in an ##IF ... ##ENDIF block

** NOTE: On lines meant for the cpp, the '!' character is reserved for
         the binary boolean negation operator. Comments at the end of
	 cpp lines should be enclosed in '/*' and '*/' delimiters.
	 These dilimiters are not valid in Fortran lines, including comments.
	 For example, the lines '! MSP /*\' and '! MSP \*/' cause errors.
	 Normal Fortran comments beginning with '!' and containing no
	 '/*' or '*/' are valid.

Example (from fcm/dimens.fcm):

            INTEGER MAXVEC
      ##IFN VECTOR PARVECT               (maxvec_spec)
            integer(chm_int),PARAMETER :: MAXVEC = 10     
      ##ELIF LARGE XLARGE                (maxvec_spec)
            integer(chm_int),PARAMETER :: MAXVEC = 4000
      ##ELIF MEDIUM                      (maxvec_spec)
            integer(chm_int),PARAMETER :: MAXVEC = 2000 
      ##ELIF SMALL                       (maxvec_spec)
            integer(chm_int),PARAMETER :: MAXVEC = 2000
      ##ELIF XSMALL                      (maxvec_spec)
            integer(chm_int),PARAMETER :: MAXVEC = 1000 
      ##ELSE                             (maxvec_spec)
      ##ERROR 'Unrecognized size directive in DIMENS.FCM.'
      ##ENDIF                            (maxvec_spec)

 Equivalent using cpp structured directives
            INTEGER MAXVEC
      #if KEY_VECTOR == 0 || KEY_PARVECT == 0
            integer(chm_int),PARAMETER :: MAXVEC = 10     
      #elif KEY_LARGE == 1 || KEY_XLARGE == 1
            integer(chm_int),PARAMETER :: MAXVEC = 4000
      #elif KEY_MEDIUM == 1
            integer(chm_int),PARAMETER :: MAXVEC = 2000 
      #elif KEY_SMALL == 1
            integer(chm_int),PARAMETER :: MAXVEC = 2000
      #elif KEY_XSMALL == 1
            integer(chm_int),PARAMETER :: MAXVEC = 1000 
      #else
      #error 'Unrecognized size directive in DIMENS.FCM.'
      #endif

Note: Although the above example illustrates the syntax of cpp equivalent prefx commands
      none of the keywords above are supported any longer.


When multiple keywords are specified, an "OR" condition is implied.
IF an "AND" condition is required, use a nested ##IF construct.
In the example above, MAXVEC will not be 10 if either VECTOR or
PARVECT is specified.
 
The text ".not." may be added before a keyname to test for its inverse.
For example, the following constructs are equivalent:

         ##IFN BLOCK                    ##IF .not.BLOCK

but these are not equivalent:
         ##IFN BLOCK TSM                ##IF .not.BLOCK  .not.TSM

This is because the the first will select when both are false but the second
will select when either is false.

In the cpp syntax these are
        #if KEY_BLOCK != 1
        #if KEY_BLOCK != 1 && KEY_TSM != 1 versus #if KEY_BLOCK != 1 || KEY_TSM != 1
In cpp it is more transparaent what the boolean logic is.

** NOTE: The single line syntax noted below is not supported as part of the
         cpp format style and should no longer be used.

Selective compilation may also be done using on a single line using
a "!##" construct.  The syntax is:
        standard-fortran-line    !## keyword(s)  ! comments

A space is not required between the "!##" and the keyword list.
For example the following constructs are equivalent:

Standard format:      
      ##IF LONGLINE
            QLONGL=.TRUE.
      ##ELSE
            QLONGL=.FALSE.
      ##ENDIF

Compact format (with comments):      
            QLONGL=.TRUE.     !##LONGLINE       ! specify the QLONGL flag
            QLONGL=.FALSE.    !##.not.LONGLINE  ! based on compilation options

Both "and" and "or" conditions can be used for one line processing:
            !##PERT  !##PARALLEL   - An "AND" conditional compile
            !##PERT PARALLEL       - An "OR" conditional compile

      
NOTE: To assist the automatic ##IF checking utilities, please do not place
## characters in the source code (other than on comment lines) unless
absolutely necessary.

CODE EXPANSION

For computational intensive routines which are not too large, code expansion
may be used to increase efficiency.  This is achieved by moving constant IF
conditions to the outside of major loops. Code expansion is optional and (if
done properly) the code should function in both expanded and unexpanded forms.
This means that the code should be written and tested in an unexpanded
form and then retested with expansion enabled.


##EXPAND local-flag(s) .when.  conditional-flag(s)   (identifier)

Expand subcommands control section (immediately following the ##EXPAND):
     ##PASS1 flag1 flag2 ... 
     ##PASS2 flag1 flag2 ... 
     ##PASS3 ...   - code sections and conditions for each pass
     ##PASS[n] ... 
     ##EXFIN       - code section for the termination of the expand section
     ##EXEND       - end of expansion specification
##ENDEX   (identifier)
    (the identifier is required and must match the corresponding ##EXPAND).
    For each pass, the specified flags are temporarily set (or .not. set)
    as requested.  If all of the conditions for the code expansion (flags
    specified after the .when. construct) are not set, then all flags from
    the ##EXPAND line (before the .when.) are temporarily set and no code
    expansion is processed.

Example (from nbonds/enbfs8.src):
      ...
      ...
      ...
      !--- Do block expansion of code
      ##EXPAND  B  forces    .when. BLOCK EXPAND  (expand_block)
      ##PASS1  .not.forces
            IF(QBLOCK .AND. NOFORC) THEN
      ##PASS2  forces
            ELSE IF(QBLOCK) THEN
      ##PASS3 .not.BLOCK  forces
            ELSE
      ##EXFIN
            ENDIF
      ##EXEND
      
            mainloop: DO I=1,NATOMX       ! Begin of main loop
      ...
      ...
      ...
               frcloop: IF (.NOT. NOFORC) THEN     !##B
      ##IF forces
               DX(I)=DX(I)+DTX
               DY(I)=DY(I)+DTY
               DZ(I)=DZ(I)+DTZ
      ##ENDIF
               ENDIF frcloop                     !##B
      ...
      ...
      ...
            ENDDO mainloop              ! End of main loop
      
      ##ENDEX    (expand_block)
            RETURN
            END subroutine enbfs8

This example will do a multi pass compilation when BOTH the
"EXPAND" and the "BLOCK" keywords are set.  If they are not both
set, then the local flags "B" and "forces" will be set until
the corresponding ##ENDEX is reached.  If the "EXPAND" and "BLOCK"
conditions are met, then the body of the expanded section will be
compiled three times.
 PASS1 - additional active flag:             disabled flag: forces
 PASS2 - additional active flag: forces      disabled flag: 
 PASS3 - additional active flag: forces      disabled flag: BLOCK

RESERVED KEYWORDS

The following keywords are reserved:
      END       - The end of keywords in pref.dat (END is not a keyword)
      SINGLE    - Conversion to single precision   (SINGLE is a keyword)
      PUTFCM    - Include files are to be copied into fortran files
      VMS       - Use VMS directory names (from DEC's DCL)
      REMIMPNON - Remove any "IMPLICIT NONE" lines found in the source
      FCMDIR    - Specification of include file directory
      UPPERCASE - Convert all non-text code to uppercase Fortran
      LONGLINE  - Allows a longer line output format (>80 characters).
      SAVEFCM   - Include all SAVE statements
      EXPAND    - Do semi-automatic code expansion
      single-letter - reserved for unexpanded compile conditionals
      lower-case    - reserved for local compile flags (within a routine)
      IF IFN ELIF ELSE ENDIF - prefx logic
      KEYWORDS LIST FILL - prefx macro.
      ERROR      - stop preprocessing and exit with error code

Other Keyword Rules
  - Keyword may not exceed 12 characters in length.
  - Global keywords must be all uppercase
  - Local  keywords must be all lowercase
  - Keywords should otherwise follow fortran standards for naming
  - Recommendation: Avoid one and two letter keywords (harder to find)

     preflx.dat or pref.dat are the preprocessor instruction data files.
Create a file preflx.dat or pref.dat (with UNIX) that contains 
one or more of the keywords specified below.  On UNIX platforms, install.com
generates the default pref.dat file in build/{machine_type} directory.
"END" keyword stops parsing keywords.  

The use of a (Match-Token) can help to identify the components of ##IF
blocks in source files that make heavy use of ## directives; it should
follow any keywords, and must be appended to all components of a given
##IF block. It should always be used with the exception of very short
non-embedded ##IF blocks. See the code for more examples.
