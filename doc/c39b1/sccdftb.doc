REMOve:  Classical energies within QM atoms are removed.

CHRG:    Net charge in the QM subsystem.

         The atoms in selection will be treated as QM atoms.

GLNK atom-selection: contains a list of atoms that are selected as
                     GHO boundary atoms.

TEMPerature:  Specifies the electronic temperature (Fermi distribution).
              Can be used to accelerate or achieve SCF convergence 
              (default =0.0).
              
SCFtolerance: Convergence criteria for the SCF cycle. As default
              a value of 1.d-7 is used.

CUTF: a flag that turns on cut-off, will use the same scheme used for
      MM interactions (allows atom-based fshift and shift). This option 
      is recommended for QM-MM interactions in EWAD calculation.

EWAD: a flag that turns on ewald summation for QM-QM and QM-MM 
      electrostatic interactions
EOPT: performs an internal optimization for kappa and kmax as well as
      real-space sum. NOT recommended - very inefficient. incompatible
      with CUTF
KAPPA, KMAX, KSQMAX: parameters used for QM-QM and QM-MM ewald 
      contributions.

PMEW: a flag that turns on particle mesh ewald (PME) summation for 
      QM-QM and QM-MM electrostatic interactions
FFTX, FFTY, FFTZ: Integer numbers of Fast Fourier Transform grid points
      for the charge mesh (default 32)
ORDEr: specifies the order of the B-spline interpolation, e.g. cubic is
       order 4, fifth degree is ORDEr 6 (default).  The ORDEr must be 
       an even number and at least 4.

UPDT: Whether to update the box during a MD run. Default is 0 (not update!)
      Do NOT forget to specify this to 1 when running CPT calculations
      (although additional tests should be done for CPT in terms of virial 
       calculations!)

MULL: Transfer the mulliken charges to the CG array such that they can be
      printed out by transferring the CG array to any vectors (e.g.,
      scalar wmain = charge; print coor)

DISP: Dispersion interactions among QM atoms can be calculated using an 
      empirical formular (Elstner et al. J. Chem. Phys. 114, 5149, 2001).
      One needs to specify a set of parameters in the DISPERSION.INP file
      (see the above ref for details).

HBON: The short-range behavior of XH gamma function is modified with a damping 
      function. This significantly enhances the hydrogen bonding interactions
      (Elstner, Cui, unpublished). The damping exponent needs to be specified
      in the sccdftb.dat file. However, with the modified gamma, the repulsive
      potential has to be adjusted accordingly. This can be done in an
      empirical fashion by including a Gaussian (constrained to operate in
      a range by a switching function) in the relevant repulsive potential;
      the parameters for the Gaussian and the switching function need to be
      specified in the spl file and turned on using the GAUS keyword.

DHUB: --> obsolete keyword (but still fully functional): use D3RD instead.
      To improve proton affinities, which depend much on the charges in the
      protonated DHGA and deprotonated molecules, the SCC-DFTB is expanded
      to the 3rd order. Currently only on-site terms have been included,
      which were observed to have a major impact on the calculated PAs for
      many molecules. The relevant parameters are the derivative of the
      Hubbard parameters (related to chemical hardness), which need to be
      specified in the sccdftb.dat file. The DHGA keyword includes further
      flexibility in the behavior of the Hubbard parameters as a function of
      charge (Elstner, Cui, JPC-A, 111, 10861-10873 (2007)).

D3RD: Full 3rd order extension of SCC-DFTB. For invoking DFTB3 
      (JCTC 2011,7,931) D3RD should be used in combination with HBON. 
      The necessary parameters (Hubbard derivatives) need to be
      specified in the sccdftb.dat file (see below).

SCFC: instead of using energy difference between iterations to determine SCF
      convergence, use difference in Mulliken charge between iterations. The
      threshold is 0.05*sqrt(SCFtolerance). This option can be useful when
      very tight convergence is desired (see, e.g., SI of JCP, 127, 234504
      (2007))

QDIP: indicate that QM dipole moment will be written to file of unit # UDIP.
      Can be useful for IR calculations using ACF of QM dipoles.

SHES: Save "dd1.dat" file in finite differences frequency calculations
      (DIAG FINITE and REDU FIX FINITE)

RHES: Read in "dd1.dat" file (from parent directory of the calculation)

CDKO: The Charge-Dependent Klopman-Ohno flag activates a short-range
      damping of the 1/r electrostatic interaction between QM (SCC-DFTB) 
      and MM atoms taking into account charge-penetration effects. It 
      is particularly useful for describing highly charged species in 
      a QM/MM setup such as phosphate hydrolysis reactions in 
      biological systems and was investigated in combination with 
      an optimized set of element type dependent QM Van der Waals 
      parameters (Hou, Cui, in preparation). The relevant parameters 
      need to be specified in a separate input file named ko_para.inp 
      (see below for details) that needs to be located in the directory
      where CHARMM is executed (similar to sccdftb.dat). Note, when 
      using in combination with LDEP the s-orbital Hubbard (and deriv)
      is taken as the QM Hubbard for the QM/MM interaction.

UNPE: Followed by a floating-point number this flag specifies the 
      number of unpaired electrons and invokes the inclusion of 
      spin-polarization effects in a collinear description (see e.g.
      JPC-A 2007,111,5622. and refs therein).

LDEP: L-dependence of the Hubbard parameters. This option should only be
      used with DFTB parameters that are designed for l-dependence! If 
      D3RD is switched on also the Hubbard derivative parameters for s-, 
      p-, and d-orbitals are necessary and need to be specified in the
      sccdftb.dat (see below). An example for this option is provided
      in test/c38test/sccdftb_ldep.inp.

MIXE: Needs an integer(0/1/2) to be input to specify the charge-mixing scheme
      to be used in the SCF iterations.
      0 : Simple mixing scheme
      1 : Anderson mixing scheme (recommended)
      2 : Broyden mixing scheme (default)

      For the Anderson mixing scheme, the LAPACK subroutine DGESV is required.
      Hence the CHARMM executable has to be linked to INTEL MKL. For the
      Anderson implementation to work, the following need to be done:

      (a) Modify the last line of Makefile_(machine type) for MKL specifications. 
      (b) Add +DFTBMKL to the installation command line such that DFTBMKL gets
          included in the generated pref.dat. An example can be:
          ./install.com gnu large T IFORT +DFTBMKL  

      If MIXE is specified as '1' in the input without having compiled CHARMM
      with MKL, the Broyden mixer will be used instead of Anderson.

      As an example, when compiling for the 'gnu' machine type, the following is 
      one possible option to be APPENDED to the last line of build/UNX/Makefile_gnu
      (where $MKLPATH and $MKLINCLUDE have been pre-defined appropriately):
      
      -L$(MKLPATH) -I$(MKLINCLUDE) -lmkl_intel_lp64 -lmkl_sequential -lmkl_core -lpthread -lm
 
GENS: Number of iterations (including the current one) whose input and output 
      charges are mixed in the Anderson mixing scheme. Generally, 5-6 should be
      sufficient. Default: 8

SYMM: A real number, in order to avoid linear dependency near the convergence
      region in the Anderson mixing scheme. Default: 0.01 (recommended)

IGUESS: Order of DXL-BOMD algorithm for charge propagation from previous
      dynamics. The input value and real order correspondence is [ 105: 1,
      107: 3, 109: 5, 111: 7, 113: 9, 115: 11, 117: 13].
      The details of the algorithm can be found in J. Chem. Phys. (135,
      044122, 2011). The default value is 0, which means getting charge from
      the previous geometry converged values.

IDAMP: Number of damping steps in DXL-BOMD. The number of steps before turning
      on DXL-BOMD algorithm.

     In the SCCDFTB program the atomtypes are represented by consecutive 
numbers. The definition of SCCDFTB atom numbers has to be accomplished 
before invoking the SCCDFTB command. The numbers are stored in WMAIN.
If the QM system e.g contains only O, N, C and H atoms,
the the numbering can be executed as follows:

scalar WMAIN set 1.0 sele type O*  SHOW end
scalar WMAIN set 2.0 sele type N*  SHOW end
scalar WMAIN set 3.0 sele type C*  SHOW end
scalar WMAIN set 4.0 sele type H*  SHOW end

Now, the O atoms are represented by 1.0, the N atoms by 2.0 etc. 

        Link atom may be added between an QM and MM atoms with the
following command:

ADDLinkatom  link-atom-name  QM-atom-spec  MM-atom-spec

      link-atom-name ::= a four character descriptor starting with QQ.

      atom-spec::= {residue-number atom-name}
                   { segid  resid atom-name }
                   { BYNUm  atom-number     }

        When using link atoms to break a bond between QM and MM
regions bond and angle parameters have to be added to parameter file
or better use READ PARAm APPEnd command.

        If define is used for selection of QM region put it after all
ADDLink commands so the numbers of atoms in the selections are not
changed. Link atoms are always selected as QM atoms.

	Currently, three different link atom schemes are implemented. 
SLA(default), EXGR and DIV. For a detailed comparison between them, see
J. Phys. Chem. B 109, 9082-9095 (2005). Briefly, SLA should be avoided 
if there is major charge change during the QM/MM calculations (e.g.,
deprotonation). EXGR in general works well, but can be problematic if the
QM region interacts directly with the mainchain NH (in the same group as
CA and therefore can be excluded from interacting with QM).

Example:
SCCDFTB DIV remove CHRG 2 SELE resn @m END TEMP 0.00 SCFT 0.00000001

SCCDFTB input files
-------------------

SCCDFTB needs to read in the parameter files, which have 
a two-body character. Therefore, the interaction parmeters
for all pairs of atoms have to be read in.
These files are named like oo.spl, on.spl, oc.spl, no.spl etc.,
where oo.spl contains the two-center integrals for the O-O interaction,
on.spl the  two-center integrals for the O-N interaction etc.
DFTB needs these parameters for the O-N and N-O interaction,
similarily for all other pairwise interactions.
The file sccdftb.dat contains the paths to these parameters, as:

'potential:atom-1-atom-1'
'potential:atom-1-atom-2'
'potential:atom-1-atom-3'
... \\
'potential:atom-1-atom-N' 
'potential:atom-2-atom-1' 
... \\
'potential:atom-2-atom-N' 
'potential:atom-N-atom-1' 
... \\
'potential:atom-N-atom-N'

where atom-1 is the atom defined by 1.0, as described above,
atom-2 defined in WMAIN by 2.0 etc.

If open-shell treatment via UNPE is specified, SCC-DFTB needs to read 
in the spin-polarization constants. These are listed directly after the 
parameter files section, one line for each atom type as defined in 
WMAIN and following the same order as above (first line for atom-1, 
second line for atom-2, and so on). Each line needs to look like: 

spin-'dummy' Wss Wsp Wps Wpp Wsd Wpd Wdd Wds Wdp

where for readability 'dummy' can be the name of the atom type (e.g. c
for carbon). Values for the constants Wss,... can be found in the 
Dissertation thesis of Christof Koehler, 2003, Unviversity Paderborn, 
page 114f, which is also available online via 
http://digital.ub.uni-paderborn.de/hs/content/titleinfo/3163

When third order DFTB is invoked via D3RD (or the now obsolete keyword 
DHUB) the Hubbard derivatives Ud need to be specified following the 
parameter file section, or the spin-section if the UNPE keyword is used:

'dummy' Ud-atom1
'dummy' Ud-atom2
...

For values of Ud see JCTC 2011,7,931.

When D3RD and LDEP is specified the Hubbard derivatives section looks
like:

'dummy' Ud-atom1-d-orbital Ud-atom1-p-orbital Ud-atom1-s-orbital
'dummy' Ud-atom2-d-orbital Ud-atom2-p-orbital Ud-atom2-s-orbital
...

If DHGA is specified (again, this is an obsolete option and was only 
used in combination with DHUB), one line containing three number follow 
in the form:

v0_hgau alp_hgau q0_hgau 

For details see JCTC 2008,4,2067.

For HBON one additional parameter 'zeta' is necessary which is set as a
single number in a single line following all previous sections (if 
invoked via corresponding keyword).


An example of a system containing O N C and H and having specified the 
keywords UNPE 1.0, D3RD, and HBON, sccdftb.dat would look like:

'PATH/oo.spl'
'PATH/on.spl'
'PATH/oc.spl'
'PATH/oh.spl'
'PATH/no.spl'
'PATH/nn.spl'
'PATH/nc.spl'
'PATH/nh.spl'
'PATH/co.spl'
'PATH/cn.spl'
'PATH/cc.spl'
'PATH/ch.spl'
'PATH/ho.spl'
'PATH/hn.spl'
'PATH/hc.spl'
'PATH/hh.spl'
spin-o     -0.035 -0.030 -0.030 -0.028 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0
spin-n     -0.033 -0.027 -0.027 -0.026 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0
spin-c     -0.031 -0.025 -0.025 -0.023 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0
spin-h     -0.072  0.0    0.0    0.0   0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0
'o' -0.19
'n' -0.13
'c' -0.23
'h' -0.16
4.2

where PATH specifies the path to the directory where the data files 
are located. Be careful, an error in the sequence or a wrong assingnment
 of parameters to atoms (coordinates) will make results meaningless.
Parameter files can be downloaded at www.dftb.org or
requested from Marcus Elstner (marcus.elstner@kit.edu). 

Another input file is necessary if the CDKO keyword is applied. 
It contains two parameters for each QM atom type and one atom-size 
describing parameter for each element appearing in the MM part. The
file is called ko_para.inp and needs to look like:

nQMatomtypes nMMelements
WMAIN:atom-1             a:atom-1  b:atom-1
WMAIN:atom-2             a:atom-2  b:atom-2 
...                      ...
WMAIN:nQMatomtypes       a:atom-nQMatomtypes  b:atom-nQMatomtypes
<blank line>
name:MMelement1   U:MMelement1
name:MMelement2   U:MMelement2
...               ...
name:nMMelements  U:nMMelements

For the sccdftb.dat example above, the number of QM atomtypes is
nQMatomtypes = 4 (O,N,C, and H), if the MM part is composed solely out 
of water the number of MM elements nMMelements = 2, where 
name:MMelement1 is O and name:MMelement2 is H. a, b, and U are the 
corresponding parameters which will soon be published for phosphate
hydrolysis reactions (Hou, Cui, in preparation).
An example for this scheme is provided in test/c37test/sccdftb_cdko.inp

	Free energy perturbations with SCC-DFTB/MM

The code currently allows dual-topology based SCC-DFTB/MM free energy
perturbation calculations; since all scaling related to the QM component
of the free energy derivative is done inside SCC-DFTB, the FEP 
calculations do not have to use BLOCK.

As discussed in JPC, 107, 8643 (2003), a practical problem of using
FEP with QM/MM potentials is that the structure of the QM region 
undergoes significant distortions at end-points if one scales the entire
QM molecule; there is no such problem if one chooses to scale only
QM/MM interactions, but that requires calculation of new terms. The
general solution is to add harmonic constraints on the QM part -
either only at the end-points and then re-weight the calculated free 
energy derivatives - or, more elegantly, add harmonic constraints 
as "chaperones" throughout the "alchemy" simulation and compute 
corrections based on local configuration integrals. See W. Yang et al. 
J. Chem. Phys. 2004.

For the special case where the two end-states have very similar chemical
structures - such as in redox, metal-exchange and pKa applications, 
which we believe are scenarios where QM/MM treatment is useful, a simple
dual-topology-single-coordinate (DTSC) approach has been introduced. As
the name implies, one uses only one set of coordinates for the two 
states (e.g., reduced and oxidized states). Due to the fact that the 
free energy is path-independent, such an approach is formally exact. In 
practical applications, error might arise due to SHAKE - i.e. X-H 
distances are assumed to the same in the two states - which usually has 
negligible effects.

At each configuration (hence single-coordinate) along the trajectory, 
two electronic structure calculations are carried out (dual topology) 
and the free energy derivative with respect to the coupling parameter 
is evaluated and averaged on the fly. 

With minor modifications, the algorithm also works for pKa prediction
for a specific group in large molecules. For more details, refer to the
following publications:

	M. Formaneck, G. Li, X. Zhang, Q. Cui, J. Thero. Comput. Chem.
	1, 53-68 (2002) 
	G. Li, X. Zhang, Q. Cui, J. Phys. Chem. B (2003) 107, 8643
	G. Li, Q. Cui, J. Phys. Chem. B, (2003) 107, 14521

NOTE BENE: It MUST be used with "FAST OFF" because only generic 
atom-atom codes have been modified so far (made default).

Due to the fact that ALL QM related components are handled within SCC
(including GSBP and eWald, see next section), FEP (such as pKa) 
calculations can be used with both eWald and GSBP - provided that it is 
the QM part that undergoes "alchemical" mutation. 
The code has NOT been extensively tested in which both QM and MM 
undergo changes.

        Two examples are given to illustrate computational details; the
first one deals with redox potential calculations for FAD in Cholesterol
oxidase, and the second one concerns pKa calculations of ethanethiol
(Ch3CH2SH) in water. The test files are scc_fep_dtsc.inp and 
scc_pka1/2.inp.

atom selection 2: Reactant state

--------------------------------------------------------------------

For pKa calculations, two free energy simulations are in 
principle required; in the first step, the protonated state is mutated
into the ionized state as the acidic proton is mutated into a dummy atom
in the second step, the dummy atom is transferred into the gas phase. 
Test calculations indicate that the contribution from the 2nd step is 
likely to be small.

Note that with BLOCK, the coefficient matrix is different in the 
second step: we are only scaling the non-bond (vdW) interaction between
the environment and the dummy atom (1 and 3). The bonded terms between
the QM and the dummy atom (2 and 3) is kept (coefficient as 1.0) and
will be taken out with local configuration integrals.

     Since 2004, electrostatics in SCC-DFTB/MM simulations can be 
treated in several ways for both spherical and periodic conditions:
i). As for other QM packages, the default is no cut-off for QM/MM 
electrostatic interactions. This is NOT recommended when cut-off 
is used for MM; the imbalance will cause over-polarization of the media
(e.g.,see discussion in classical simulations by Woods, J. Chem. Phys. 
103, 6177, 1995). A useful option is to use extended electrostatics for
MM.

ii). Cut-off is introduced for QM/MM electrostatics, similar to MM
interactions; i.e., the same scaling factors are the same as those for 
MM interactions. Simply add "CUTF" to the SCC-DFTB command line.
Currently only supports energy/force-shifts based on atoms

iii). For spherical boundary conditions, the
GSBP approach can now be used with SCC-DFTB. The current implementation
takes GSBP contributions into the SCF iteration, although for a large
inner region, this may not be necessary. Further tests are being carried
out. The code will be extended to other boundary conditions and QM 
methods in the future. If one uses sorting (i.e., truncate size of
basis in GSBP), make sure a SCC-DFTB/MM 
energy calculation with MULL (save Mulliken charge) is carried out 
before issuing GSBP, since the Mulliken charges are used to estimate
contributions from various basis functions to the QM related terms. 
See test cases for examples.

The GSBP and PB reference calculations are made consistent in terms of 
reference state and the boundaries are updated in the PB calculations. 
Simple test on a simple sodium ion led to correct answer with different EPSP
values.

The implementation is described in: J. Chem. Phys. 123, 014905 (2005).

iv). For PBC simulations, one can use either cut-off or eWald sum for
SCC-DFTB/MM interactions. Also PME has been implemented for the QM/MM 
interactions but no extensive performance checks have been carried out
yet. The current QM/MM implementation allows in principle all cell shapes.
For eWald, one can either let the code optimize the exponent to get the
best balance between real space sum and the reciprocal space sum (EOPT)
or one can specify a set of parameters (Kappa, KMAX, KSQMAX).
The real space sum is done till convergence is met with EOPT or 
without CUTF (so more expensive); EOPT is incompatible with CUTF.
With cutoff (CUTF), the real sum is limited to atoms within the cutoff- 
which is recommended (much more efficient). In any case, one should
carefully test kappa, KMAX to ensure the convergence of energy and, 
more importantly, force from SCC-DFTB/MM calculations. 

A sample command line would be:
......
SCCDFTB remove CHRG 2 SELE resn @m END TEMP 0.00 SCFT 0.00000001 EWAD -
CUTF Kappa 0.45  KMAX 6 KSQMAX 100
......

With the 2009 implementation, QM/MM-eWald without CUTF is about 4-6 
times slower than a QM/MM calculation without eWald (i.e., with only cutoff).
With real-space cutoff (CUTF), QM/MM-eWald is only slightly slower than QM/MM
without eWald. In 2012, QM/MM-PME has been implemented for SCC-DFTB by the 
Gao group. For an example, see test/c37test/sccdftb_pme.inp.

The eWald implementation is described in: J. Phys. Chem. B 109, 17715-17733
(2005). The PME implementation follows the same approach as established for 
SQUANTM as described in J. Chem. Theory Comput, 1, 2-13 (2005).

An important point for PBC simulations is that all image must be used 
with "UPDAte IMAL ". This is because symmetry operations have not been
considered in the SCC-DFTB/MM code - which obviously needs to be fixed
in the future.

The eWald implementation is described in: J. Phys. Chem. B 109, 17715-17733
(2005)

v).  SCC-DFTB has been implemented to work with Poisson-Boltzmann, which
allows to calculate solvation free energy and optimize reaction path with
implicit solvent. Several keywords are added to the PBEQ module:

	PSTL(0.01 kcal/mol): Energy convergence criterion of the iterative
             QM-PB calculation

	MXPS(5000): Maximum # of SCC and PB solver iterations. 

	IGAS: flag to initiate calculation from gas phase in every step,
             otherwise from last step (this is default for solvation free
             energy calculation).

	CHDR: instead of a fixed set of atomic radii, use charge-depdent radii,
             which can be useful for charged species (Hou, Zhu and QC,
             unpublished). In this case, a file named radius.inp, which
             contains optimized parameters for the charge-dependence of atomic
             radius, must be included in the local directory, similar to
             sccdftb.dat.

[GLNK atom-selection]

atom-selection: contains a list of atoms that are boundary atoms.

Restrictions: see the correponding entry for GLNK in quantum.doc

Description:  see the correponding entry for GLNK in quantum.doc

Limitations: The present implementation allows up to 5 QM-boundary
atoms. To improve the geometry for the QM/MM boundary bond, an
empirical correction (Ecor) term is added. Currently, Ecor parameters
are only available for cases where the QM/MM partition cuts a C-C,
a C-O, or a C-S bond.  For other cases, no empirical corrections
will be included. Unrestricted GHO-SCC-DFTB for open-shell system
is not implemented.

Reference: Reference made to the following paper, which contains
a more thorough description and discussion of test cases, is appreciated.

     The current implementation has analytical first derivative and thus
allows energy minimizations, reaction path search (e.g., travel) and
molecular dynamics simulations; SCC-DFTB/MM also works with Monte Carlo.
Replica can also be used, which makes it possible to use replica path
and related approaches (such the nudged elastic band) for determining
reaction path with the SCC-DFTB/MM potential; along the same line,
path integral simulations can be carried out as well, although only for
equilibrium properties at this stage.


     Several aspects of the code will be improved in the near future, 
and new functionalities will be added:

1. Interface with centroid path-integral simulations and Tsallis
   statistics.
2. More flexible interface with BLOCK for general free energy 
   simulations.
3. Better methods for open-shell systems; constrained density functional
   theories.
4. Time-dependent treatment for electronically excited states; non-adiabtic MD.
5. Integration with polarizable force field models (Drude).
