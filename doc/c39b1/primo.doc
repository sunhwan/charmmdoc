                       PRIMO Module of CHARMM

Recently developed PRIMO model(proteins2010, 78:1266) consists of interaction 
sites made up of one to three atoms. The recontruction from PRIMO to atomistic 
phase is based on analytic relations based on the standard bonding geometries 
observed in atomistic models.

Since PRIMO energy surface is smoother compared to the rugged one of atomistic
phase, coarse-grained conformations are tolerant of small local[bond/angle] 
deformations which are forbidden in atomistic phase. This is a serious issue, 
since the analytic reconstruction would not guarantee good energetic structure 
in atomisitic phase. To alleviate this issue, a serious of virtual atoms are 
constructed and used to restrict the sampling of coarse-grained particles. 
Three types of virtual atoms(vs1,vs2,vs3) are supported as sketched below.



        vs1                   [4]    
          .                  /  
           .            q2  /   
        b1  .           t2 /
             .            /                 
             [1]--------[3]
      t1    /             .         
      q1   /               . b2     
          /                 .    
         /                   .  
       [2]                   vs2-------[5].......vs3 


Here [1],[2],[3],[4],[5] are the coarse-grained(CG) sites. Virtual site vs1 is 
constructed using the bond distance vs1-[1], angle vs1-[1]-[2] and dihedral 
vs1-[1]-[2]-[3]. Virtual site vs2 is constructed using bond vs2-[3], angle 
vs2-[3]-[1] and dihedral vs2-[3]-[4]-vs1. Virtual site vs3 is estimated as 
2*[5]-vs2.

Harmonic distance and angle potential involving virtual sites are supported.

RESN       constructs virtual atom for residue-selection. The residue 
           selection should contain one residue(ALA,PHE..) and must be 
           recognizable by RES(I) array of charmm module

CSTEP      evaluate potential during every CSTEP

VS1        specifies virtual site vs1 construction           

ATM1
ATM2       atom selections for building vs1, specified as CG particle name
ATM3       prefixed by '+', '-' or '' to indicate selection belongs to 
           either next, previous or same residue as vs1 respectively.

B1         Equilibrium bond length: vs1 and ATM1
T1         Equilibrium bond angle:  vs2, ATM1 and ATM2
Q1         Equilibrium dihedral: vs3, ATM1, ATM3 and ATM4

VS2        specifies virtual site vs2 construction

ATM4       atom selection for building virtual site vs3 (in addition to 
           ATM1,2,3..see above)

B2         Equilibrium bond length: vs2 and ATM3
T2         Equilibrium bond angle:  vs2, ATM3 and ATM4
Q2         Equilibrium dihedral: vs2, ATM3, ATM4 and virtual vs3

VS3        specifies virtual vs3 construction

ATM5       atom selection for building CG-atom (in addition to ATM1,2,3,4)


DIS1       distance based harmonic potential between vs1 and CG particle

DSEL1      atom selection for DIS1

KDT1       spring constant for DIS1
MND1       Equilibrium distance for DIS1


ANG1       angle based harmonic potential between vs1 and CG particles

ASEL1      atom selections for ANG1 potential. 
ASEL2      

KTH1       spring constant for ANG1
MNT1       Equilibrium angle for ANG1

The meaning DIS2, DSEL2, KDT2, MND2 and DIS3 DSEL3 KDT3 MD3 are similar to the 
above definitions and are valid for vs2 and vs3 sites respecitively.

Similarly ANG2, ASEL3, ASEL4, KTH2, MNT2 are for vs2 angle potential and ANG3, 
ASEL5, KTH3, MNT3 are for vs3 site respectively.

                                  Examples

Example (1)

Construct virtual C-atom for ala and restrain it with respect to PRIMO 
N-particle. This emulates N-CA-C angle term.

primo resn ala vs1 b1 0.616 t1 41.50 q1 0.0 -
atm1 CO atm2 +N  atm3 CA -
dis1 dsel1 sele (resname ala .and. atom * * N) end kdt1 30.0 mnd1 2.472


Example (2)

Maintain the planarity of phe by applying an angle term between SC1, 
virtual-CG atom and SC2 particles. Apply the potential every 5th md step

primo resn phe cstep 5 vs1 b1 0.616 t1 41.50 q1 0.0 -
           vs2 b2 1.552 t2 111.0 q2 -122.0 vs3 -
           atm1 CO atm2 +N atm3 CA atm4 N atm5 SC1 -
           ang3 asel5 sele (resname phe .and. atom * * SC1) end -
           asel6 sele (resname phe .and. atom * * SC2) end kth3 10.0 mnt3 150.0

Example (3)

The above task could also be accomplished by using a distance potential between 
virtual-CB and SC1/SC2 atoms of phe.

primo resn phe cstep 5 vs1 b1 0.616 t1 41.50 q1 0.0 -
           vs2 b2 1.552 t2 111.0 q2 -122.0 atm1 CO atm2 +N atm3 CA atm4 N -
           dis2 dsel2 -
           sele (resname phe .and.  (atom * * SC2 .or. atom * * SC3) ) end -
           kdt2 30.0 mnd2 3.814


In all the cases the value of spring constant, must be carefully chosen as not 
to adversely affect the CG conformational sampling. 

Application of PRIMO module as residual PRIMO force field terms is given in 
the CHARMM test case.
