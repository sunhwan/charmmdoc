        Combined Quantum Mechanical and Molecular Mechanics Method
                        Based on Q-Chem in CHARMM

                             H. Lee Woodcock
                             (hlwood@nih.gov)

          based on the GAMESS(US) interface from Milan Hodoscek
           (milan@par10.mgsl.dcrt.nih.gov,milan@kihp6.ki.si)
                                  and 
              the GAMESS(UK) interface from Paul Sherwood
                       (p.sherwood@dl.ac.uk)

        Ab initio program Q-Chem is connected to CHARMM program in a 
QM/MM method. This method is based on the interface to the GAMESS (US
version), the latter being an extension of the QUANTUM code which is
described in J. Comp. Chem., Vol. 11, No. 6, 700-733 (1990).

The QM/MM interface between Q-Chem and CHARMM is described in the 
following work which should be cited when used...

        The Q-Chem QM potential is initialized with the QCHEM command.

[SYNTAX QCHEm]

QCHEm    [REMOve] [EXGRoup] [NOGUess] [BLURred [RECAll INT]] [COORdinates] 
         [QCLJ] [PARAllel [INT]] [SHESsian] [RHESsian] [CHARge] [MICRo] [SAVE]
         [RESTart] [RESEt] (atom selection)

REMOve:  Classical energies within QM atoms are removed.

EXGRoup: QM/MM Electrostatics for link host groups removed.

NOGUess: Obtains initial orbital guess from previous calculation.
         Default is to recalculate initial orbitals each time.

BLURred: MM charges are treated as a gaussian function (equivalent to ECP)
         width of the gaussian function is specified by default in WMAIN
         array (usually by SCALar command). The value for charge is taken 
         from PSF. Some values of WMAIN have special meaning:

         WMAIN.LE.   0.0 treat this atom as point charge in the QM/MM potential
         WMAIN.GE.5000.0 treat this atom as an infinitely diffuse Gaussian 

RECAll:  Use the RECAll array (as specified in scalar.doc) to set BLUR 
         widths instead of the main WMAIN array. This is necessary when 
         using Gaussian BLUR MM charges with the Replica Path or NEB 
         methods as these make use of the WMAIN array. See QM-MM_DGMM.inp
         in the test directory for an example. 

COORdinates: This keyword will activate CHARMM to obtain an updated geometry 
         from Q-Chem as the calculation proceeds. This can be particularly 
         useful as Q-Chem can perform QM optimiztions using delocalized 
         internal coordinates in the presence of a fix field of point charges. 
         This can significantly speed QM/MM minimizations and can be used in 
         an iterative approach. Note: to use this the JOBTYPE in the Q-Chem 
         control file should be set to OPT (i.e. JOBTYPE = OPT). 

QCLJ:    Activates Q-Chem to use CHARMM's Lennard-Jones parameters when 
         performing QM calculations in a fixed field of point charges. This 
         can be particularlly useful as the QM region can be overly attracted 
         to bare point charges. 

PARAllel: Allows the user to specify how many processors they wany the Q-Chem
         calculation to utilize. Previously, Q-Chem would use the same number
         of processors as CHARMM was using, however, in most cases the Q-Chem
         calculation will be much more expensive so having 1 CHARMM process
         and 4 Q-Chem processes is more efficient. Note: This currently only 
         works with parallel versions of CHARMM although it can be extended 
         to work with serial versions. 

SHESsian: Save Hessian computed via the QM/MM Normal Mode Procedure. The 
         Hessian will be saved as an ascii file named: hessian.dat. Typically 
         VIBRAN recomputes the Hessian each time it is needed; for QM or QM/MM
         calculations this is inefficient and thus saving the Hessian becomes 
         very important. Particularly, this is used when employing the VSA 
         method (see vibran.doc). 

RHESsian: Read a previously saved Hessian (hessian.dat) from a file (see SHES).  

CHARge:  Read QM charges from an file (charges.dat). A charges.dat file is 
         created by Q-Chem by seting the REM keyword QMMM_CHARGES = TRUE. 
         This file contains the Muliken charges for the QM region in the 
         same order that is specified in the PSF file. 

MICRo:   Turns on the QM/MM Micro-iteration scheme of Kastner et al. J. Chem. 
         Theory Comput., 3 (3), 1064-1072, 2007. Currently, this is best used
         in conjunction with a loop where CHARMM alternates between MM and 
         QM/MM micro and macro cycles. Also, the CHARge keyword should be 
         used to set the charges on QM region during the MM cycles. This is a 
         new feature that requires further testing so be careful! 

RESEt:   Resets all QM/MM options to their initial defaults. This is needed 
         for the QM/MM Micro-iteration approach to alternate between MM and 
         QM/MM stages. Note: after using this a new "QCHEM" command must be 
         issued! 

SAVE:    Activates CHARMM to save the converged SCF orbitals from a given 
         energy calculation. Note: This ideally should be called once using 
         a specific Q-Chem control file that contains specialized SCF 
         convergence options. This option shoudl then be followed by a new 
         "QCHEm" call that specifies "RESTart" and performs the actual 
         QM/MM minimization. See below for example... 

RESTart: This tells CHARMM to restart a QM/MM calculation using previously 
         saved orbitals. The "QCHEm" command that uses this as an option 
         should be proceeded by a "QCHEm SAVE" command to preform an 
         initial calculation saving the orbitals. See below for example... 

         Example: 

         !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
          envi qchemcnt  "qcnt1.inp"    ! File that contains special SCF 
          envi qcheminp  "q1.inp"       ! convergence options
          envi qchemexe  "qchem"
          envi qchemout  "q1.out"
         !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

         QCHEm SAVE REMOve SELEct RESId 1 SHOW END
         ENERgy 

         !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
         envi qchemcnt  "qcnt2.inp"     ! Regular Q-Chem control file 
         !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

         QCHEm RESTart NOGUess REMOve SELEct RESId 1 SHOW END
         MINI ABNR NSTEp 10 NPRInt 1 

=======================================================================

         The atoms in selection will be treated as QM atoms.
         Link atom may be added between an QM and MM atoms with the 
         following command:

=======================================================================

ADDLinkatom  link-atom-name  QM-atom-spec  MM-atom-spec

      link-atom-name ::= a four character descriptor starting with QQ.

      atom-spec::= {residue-number atom-name}
                   { segid  resid atom-name }
                   { BYNUm  atom-number     }

        When using link atoms to break a bond between QM and MM
regions bond and angle parameters have to be added to parameter file
or better use READ PARAm APPEnd command.

        If define is used for selection of QM region put it after all
ADDLink commands so the numbers of atoms in the selections are not
changed. Link atoms are always selected as QM atoms.

File: QChem, Node: Usage, Up: Top, Next: Installation, Previous: Description

CHARMM input scripts are the same as before except the addition of ENVIronment
commands and the QCHEm command itself. Q-Chem commands are in a separate file
call qchem.inp, (or with an alternative name indicated by the "QCHEMCNT"
environment variable). The Q-Chem input file has the same structure as it
would have for a normal Q-Chem run, except that the specification of the
geometry, in the molecule section, is omitted. Note: the charge and
multiplicity are still included in the molecule section.

        Names of the files for Q-Chem are specefied with environment
variables as follows. These four ENVIronment variables must be set!

     use ENVIronment command inside CHARMM

     ENVI qchemcnt  "qchem.inp"
     ENVI qcheminp  "q1.inp"
     ENVI qchemexe  "qchem"
     ENVI qchemout  "qchem.out"

or use the following for (t)csh

     setenv qchemcnt qchem.inp
     setenv qcheminp q1.inp
     setenv qchemexe qchem
     setenv qchemout qchem.out

or use the following for ksh,sh,bash

     export qchemcnt=qchem.inp
     export qcheminp=q1.inp
     export qchemexe=qchem
     export qchemout=qchem.out

1. The QCHEMCNT variable specifies the main Q-Chem input file which contains
the $rem section, $molecule section (without geometry), $comment section,
ect..,

2. The QCHEMINP variable is the final input file that will get passed to
Q-Chem. CHARMM actually writes this file and adds the correct geometry and
any external/point charges (e.g. MM atoms) to an $external_charges section.

3. The QCHEMEXE is the location of the qchem script. Specify the entire path
unless $QC/bin is included in your default path. 

4. The QCHEMOUT file specifies the Q-Chem output file. This file get
overwritten for each optimization/time step. In the future, there will be a
mechanism to save old output files.

Q-Chem input file parameters
----------------------------

The following $rem variables must be specified in the QCHEMCNT file in order
to perform CHARMM QM/MM or pure QM calculations. 

qm_mm                 true
jobtype               force
symmetry              off
sym_ignore            true
print_input           false
qmmm_print            true

1. qm_mm = true: Turns QM/MM on in Q-Chem

2. jobtype = force: Needed to do QM/MM optimizations. Set to "SP" if QM/MM   
                    energy is desired.

3. symmetry = off: Turn off symmetry

4. sym_ignore = true: Prevents Q-Chem from reorienting molecule

5. print_input = false: Use this if you have a large molecule and do not want 
                        1000s of atoms echoed back to the output file.

6. qmmm_print = true: Reduces some of the print out during QM/MM calculations. 
                      This prevents external charges from being printed out if 
                      there are more than 50 of them.

Sample QCHEMCNT file (qchem.inp):
---------------------------------
$comment
Input file comes from CHARMM
$end

$rem
exchange              HF
basis                 6-31G*
qm_mm                 true
jobtype               force
symmetry              off
sym_ignore            true
print_input           false
qmmm_print            true
$end

$molecule
0 1
$end

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

         The above is for 6-31G calculation of any neutral molecule. 

[NOTE: For another example look at test/cquantumtest/alanine_qchem.inp]

One of the main benefits of using Q-Chem to do QM/MM calculations with CHARMM
is the ease of which you can get up and running jobs. All you have to do is
compile CHARMM in the following way....

install.com <machine-type> <CHARMM size> QC <other CHARMM options>

This will compile the serial version of CHARMM to run with a serial version of
Q-Chem. To compile a parallel version of CHARMM to run with a parallel or
serial version of Q-Chem you could use the following script....

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/csh
# Compile Parallel CHARMM with Q-Chem support

# USE STANDARD MPI (i.e. MPICH)
setenv MPI /base/mpi/directory
setenv MPI_LIB $MPI/lib
setenv MPI_LIB $MPI/include

# SET THE PATH TO MPIF77
set path=($MPI/bin $path)

install.com <machine-type> <CHARMM size> M QC MPICH <other CHARMM options>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q-Chem/CHARMM interface status (July 2007)

- Parallel version is fully functional

- Replica/Path and Nudged Elastic Band Methods function in a highly parallel  
  and parallel/parallel fashion.

- I/O including standard input and output are separated for
  Q-Chem.

- All CHARMM testcases are still OK when CHARMM is compiled
  with Q-Chem inside.

- QCHEM, GAMESS, GAMESSUK, CADPAC and QUANTUM keywords cannot coexist in
  pref.dat

- Q-Chem recognizes atoms by their masses as specified in the 
  RTF file

- Delocalized Gaussian Blurred MM charges have been implemented for both 
  energies and analytic gradients 

- Full (i.e. no restraints/constraints) QM/MM 2nd derivatives (i.e. Hessians) 
  are available. 

==============================================================================

File: QChem, Node: Functionality, Up: Top, Next: RPath, Previous: Status

1. QM/MM optimizations (analytic gradients) using Q-Chem can be performed
using the following methods.

   - HF*     (RHF, UHF, ROHF)
   - DFT*    (RHF, UHF, ROHF)
   - RIMP2   (RHF, UHF)
   - MOS-MP2 (RHF, UHF)
   - SOS-MP2 (RHF, UHF)
   - SCS-MP2 (RHF, UHF)
   - MP2     (RHF, UHF)
   - CCSD    (RHF, UHF)

* Analytic derivatives run in parallel.

2. QM/MM single point energies using Q-Chem can be performed using the
following methods (in addition to the above). 

   - Local MP2 (RHF, UHF)
   - CCSD(T)   (RHF, UHF)

3. Additional analytic derivative and energy point methods will be made 
available in future releases. To request support for methods please contact 
H. Lee Woodcock (hlwoodr_at_nih_dot_gov) and/or post request to the CHARMM 
forums. 

==============================================================================

File: QChem, Node: RPath, Up: Top, Next: Pert, Previous: Functionality

1. Additional ENVIronment variable: To do QM/MM Replica/Path or Nudged Elastic
Band calculations with CHARMM and Q-Chem you must define one extra variable. 

    ENVI QCHEMPWD "/path/to/working/rpath/directory"

2. After defining this above ENVIronment variable all that is left to do is
add the "rpath" keyword to the QCHEm call. For example...

    QCHEm RPATh REMOve select qm_region end

This will create nrep directories in /path/to/working/rpath/directory and each
point of the pathway will be computed in a different directory. 

Note: you must be running a parallel version of CHARMM with the same number of
processors as you have replicas (i.e. pathway points). 

==============================================================================

File: QChem, Node: Pert, Up: Top, Next: Normal Mode Analysis, Previous: RPath

To run ab initio QM/MM free energy perturbation you need to specify additional
environment variables in the QM/MM setup...

1. sainp: state A control file (same as QCHEMCNT; specific for state A)
2. sbinp: state B control file (same as QCHEMCNT; specific for state B)
3. stateainp: auto generated Q-Chem input file for state A 
4. statebinp: auto generated Q-Chem input file for state B
5. stateaout: specify Q-Chem output for state A QM calculation
6. statebout: specify Q-Chem output for state B QM calculation

Example... 

 envi qchemexe  "qchem"               ! Command to call quantum program
 envi qchemcnt  "data/qchem_pert.inp" ! Non Pert Control file
 envi qcheminp  "q1.inp"              ! Non Pert Quantum input file
 envi qchemout  "qchem.out"           ! Non Pert Quantum output file
 envi sainp     "data/s0.inp"         ! State 0 control file
 envi sbinp     "data/s1.inp"         ! State 1 control file

Please see pert.doc for a complete description of running free energy 
perturbation in CHARMM. 

==============================================================================

File: QChem, Node: Normal Mode Analysis, Up: Top, Next: Top, Previous: Pert

To run full QM/MM Normal Mode Analysis (i.e. QM/MM 2nd derivatives, Hessians)
you need to run QM/MM with the VIBRan module (see vibran.doc) of CHARMM. To 
perform this calculation just run QCHEm has usual... 

Example: 

 QCHEm REMOve SELEct RESId 1 SHOW END

Then invoke the VIBRan module... 

 VIBRan
 DIAG 
 END

In addition, you must add the following line to the QCHEMCNT file (the file that 
controls the the REM variables passed to Q-Chem). 

 QMMM_FULL_HESSIAN     TRUE 

Please see the "QM-MM_Normal_Modes.inp" testcase in the test directory for the 
full example. 

Currently, this only works with standard point charge QM/MM models (i.e. not 
Gaussian blurred charges), but this will be extended in the future.
