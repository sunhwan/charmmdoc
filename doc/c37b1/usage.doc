                          How to use CHARMM

        The user of CHARMM controls its execution by executing commands
sequentially from a command file or interactivly. In general the ordering
of commands is limited only by the data required by the command.
For example, the energy cannot be calculated unless the arrays holding
the coordinates, the parameters, etc., have already been filled.

        This section deals with overall usage, as opposed to the
detailed description of any given command. This is a good place to
start when first learning CHARMM.

            Starting CHARMM from Unix shell (command line or in a batch script)

       $  charmm [arguments] [< input] [>output]

       This command assumes that the charmm command is in your
        path. If not, give the fully qualified path to charmm. The
        square-bracketed arguments are optional but almost always used
        for normal runs. 

        Input and Output: 

        The charmm executable reads input from standard input and
        writes to standard output by default. The charmm input can be
        given interactively via the keyboard if no redirect of input
        is specified. Input can be redirected using "<" from a file
        but should only be done for non-parallel runs. Output can
        always be redirected to a file using ">". Alternatively the
        arguments "-i filename" or "-input filename" can be used to
        specify an input file, and "-o filename" or "-output filename"
        can be used to specify an output file.

        Command line arguments:
            ARGUMENTS may be specified in any order.
            Redirection (<, >, or |) must be specified after all arguments.
 
        -h, -help    - charmm prints allowed command line arguments and quits

        -chsize N    - sets arrays to run for maximum atoms of N, an integer 
                       specified by the user here

        -prevclcg    - runs in mode compatible with previous CLCG

        -prevrandom  - runs in old random number generator mode

        -input file  - specifies input file to be read instead of standard input
        -i file                     
     
        -output file - specifies output file to be used instead of standard output
        -o file

        var=value    - sets a scripting variable to be used in the charmm script as
                       an "@" variable, the same as the "SET" command (miscom.doc). 
                       This argument allows the same charmm script to be used with
                       different values of @ variables without editing the scripts.

        EXAMPLE:
          $ charmm
                    runs charmm interactively, all input comes from
                    keyboard, all output comes to screen.

          $ charmm < myinput.inp
                   or
          $ charmm -i myinput.inp
                    runs charmm reading input from a file in the
                    present working directory, output to screen or 
                    standard output

          $ charmm < myinput.inp > chmout.out
          $ charmm -i myinput.inp > chmout.out
          $ charmm -o chmout.out -i myinput.inp 
          $ charmm -o chmout.out < myinput.inp 
          $ charmm -i myinput.inp -o chmout.out
                    All equivalent, last recommended for parallel runs
                    runs charmm reading input from a file in the
                    present working directory, output to screen or 
                    standard output
     
          $ charmm aaa=5 rtffile=top_mine.rtf run=$nrun -prevrandom < myinput.inp

                   runs charmm, reads from myinput.inp, writes to
                   standard output. Sets three variables as if the
                   first lines in the charmm script were (where the
                   shell or environment variable nrun is 33):

                   set aaa 5
                   set rtffile top_mine.rtf
                   set run 33
 
          $ charmm -chsize 500000 -input myinput.inp

                   runs charmm, reads from myinput.inp, writes to
                   standard output. Sets size of charmm arrays to hold
                   500,000 atoms as if the first line in the charmm
                   script was:

                   dimension chsize 500000

            Configuring CHARMM Array Sizes in the CHARMM script

         The current release of CHARMM (c36b1 and beyond) allows the user
to configure the size of many key arrays in CHARMM at run-time using a CHARMM
script level command as the FIRST command following the script title. Like
the command line option -chsize <integer>, the script level commands let
you configure CHARMM's key arrays and data structures to match the problem
you are working on. The command key for resizing CHARMM arrays is DIMEnsion
or RESIze, both are recognized, followed by the particular data structure size
 you wish to change. The command is of the form:

 dimension dsize-1 <size-1> [dsize-2 <size-2> ...]

or
 resize dsize-1 <size-1> [dsize-2 <size-2> ...]

where the following data structure size names are recognized

Data Structure Size

 chsize            This is a master size that proportions all CHARMM 
                   data structures
 maxa (chsize)     This controls the maximum number of atoms
 maxb (chsize)     Maximum number of bonds
 maxt (chsize*2)   Maximum number of angles
 maxp (chsize*3)   Maximum number of proper dihedral angles
 maximp (chsize/2) Maximum number of improper dihedral angles
 maxnb (chsize/4)  Maximum number of nonbond fixes
 maxpad (chsize)   Maximum number of acceptors and donors
 maxres (chsize/3) Maximum number of residues
 maxseg (chsize/8) Maximum numebr of segments
 maxcrt (chsize/3) Maximum number of CMAP dihedrals
 maxshk (chsize)   Maximum number of SHAKE constraints
 maxaim (chsize*2) Maximum number of atoms including images
 maxgrp (chsize*2/3) Maximum number of groups

EXAMPLES:

   1) Configure all of CHARMM to accommodate 10,000 atoms

      dimension chsize 10000

   2) Configure the maximum number of atoms to be 10,000 and the maximum number of
      dihedrals and impropers to be very small (say 10)

      dimension maxa 10000 maxp 10 maximp 10

NOTE: The remaining arrays/data structures will be configured according to the
default chsize used in the CHARMM build, e.g., small, medium, large, xlarge, etc.

            Rules for Describing the Syntax (The Meta-Syntax)

        The syntax of commands is described using the following rules:
Capitalized words are keywords that must be specified as is. However, if
the word is partially capitalized, it may be abbreviated to the
capitalized part. Lower case words are to be replaced by a corresponding
data entry. The symbol "::=" means "has the following syntactic form:".
Anything enclosed in square brackets, "[]", is optional. If several
things are stacked in square brackets, one may choose one optionally.
Anything enclosed in curly brackets, "{}", specifies that a selection
must be made of the choices stacked vertically inside. The syntactic
entities which appear as an argument to "repeat" may be repeated any
number (including zero) times. Defaults for optional parameters may be
enclosed in apostrophes and placed under the entity they stand for.
However, defaults are not specified in this manner if the rules for the
default are complex.

        The syntactic glossary, see *note glossary: Syntactic Glossary,
contains further syntactic entities which are used in the command
descriptions. Finally, the options and operands in each command can
usually be specified in any order except if otherwise noted.

                    Command language rules and lore

        A CHARMM run is controlled by a command file (or files).
This section of the documentation describes the basic rules for
the command file.  Details of command level run control are described
in the next node.

        A command file for CHARMM should begin with a specification of
the title of the run. (See the syntactic glossary, *note syn: syntactic
glossary, for the syntax of a title.) Then, any number of commands may
be specified.

        Each command consists of a command line possibly followed by
other data. The command line is scanned free field. This command line
may be longer than one line in the file; to do this, one must place a
hyphen at the end of line which is to be continued on the next line.
Comments may be placed on a command line by preceding the comments by
exclamation points. All lower case characters are converted to upper
case. This format is identical to that used by the VAX command language
interpreter. In addition, blank lines are permitted to separate blocks
of commands for increased readability.

        The first word of every command line specifies the command.
Generally, required operands of a command must follow in order.
On the other hand, options may generally be specified in any
order. Further, any number is always preceded by a key word so that any
numeric operands, can be placed in arbitrary order.

        The command line is scanned in units of words and delimited
strings. A word is defined by a sequence of non-blank characters, A
delimited string consists of a keyword followed by a string of
characters of variable length followed by a delimiter string.
One example of where a delimeter string is used is in atom selection
where the syntax is;  SELE ...... END. Note, that the "END" is required and
delimits the atom selection.

        Abbreviations are permitted in various contexts. The first word
may be abbreviated to four characters and numerous options and operands
may also be abbreviated to four characters. However, some key words which
are used to mark numbers may not be abbreviated. See the processing for
individual commands to see what can and cannot be abbreviated.

        Many of the various options and numeric values are maintained
from one invocation of a command to the next. Once a value is specified,
it is maintained until it is changed in any command. Therefore, if CUTNB
is specified in a NBON command, that value will be used in the DYNA
command unless it is changed therein.

        Usually, when a free field command line is read in, it is
echoed onto a standard output. Each such echo will be prepended by a short
marker, eg. "CHARMM>", which identifies the line of input as well as the
command processor which is interpreting it.

        In general, as each of the command is interpreted, it is deleted
from the command line. When command processing is finished, a check is
made to see that nothing is left over. The presence of extraneous junk
indicates that something was mistyped. For some commands, such as DYNAmics,
where a mistake may be costly, extraneous characters result in a fatal
error.

                Controlling a CHARMM Run

The sizes of arrays can now be dynamically defined at program startup, instead
of having to recompile.  The charmm-size (chsize) is no longer limited to the
compile time flag of MEDIUM, LARGE, XLARGE, etc., and can be changed either via
the command line (see above) or the DIMEnsion command, which **MUST** be the
first command in the input file.  Otherwise, the compile time limit is used.
Other arrays may also be specified; *note DIMEnsion:(chmdoc/dimens.doc)

        DIMEsion chsize <number of atoms>  ! max number of atoms for this run

		Control Logic

        IF command-parameter test-spec comparison-string command-spec

        GOTO label-string

        LABEL label-string

        STREAM [UNIT integer]
               [file-specification]

        RETURN

        SET command-parameter string

        INCRement command-parameter [BY real]

        DECRement command-parameter [BY real]

*note Miscellaneous commands:(chmdoc/miscom.doc)

        These commands that are used to modify the usual sequential
interpretation of commands from the command file.  Three methods are
available to accomplish this: 

        IF tests to conditionally execute a single command
        GOTO and LABEL transfers within a file
        STREAM and RETURN transfers to different command files.

In addition commands can be modified by the use of command parameters.
The command line reader scans input lines for parameters (specified by
@n where n is an alphanumeric character) and will subsitute the
appropriate parameter string.  Command parameters are defined using
the SET command to set one of the 36 command parameters, and their
values (if numeric) can be modified by the INCRement command, which
decodes the parameter string, does real arithmetic and encodes the
result.  The command parameters are identified by alphanumeric
characters (0-9,A(a)-Z(z)(not case-sensitive)).

        IF compares the string in the specified parameter string
to the comparison-string using the test-spec (GT GE EQ NE LE LT).
If the comparison is true then the rest of the command line is
executed (otherwise it is ignored).  The EQ and NE comparisons are
done as string comparisons, but the others require decoding of the
two strings and comparison by real arithmetic.  The command-spec
can be any valid command line (including another IF test or
a GOTO or STREAM specification).

        GOTO causes the current command file to be rewound and
searched for a line containing the correct LABEL and label-string.
The label-string is a single word.  If multiple occurrences of a
label are present, the first will be used.  Command interpretation
begins on the line following the LABEL (any information after the
LABEL keyword and label-string is ignored).

        STREAM iunit begins reading commands from the specified
fortran logical unit or from the stream file.  The stream file is
treated exactly as the main command file.  It begins with a title and
ends with a STOP or RETURN, the latter causing control to return to
the previously active command file at the point where the stream
switch occurred.

        The logical unit in OPEN, CLOSE, and REWIND commands are
useful in working with streams see *note MISCOM:(chmdoc/miscom.doc).

EXAMPLE:

* This is a sample command file for CHARMM which calls a stream file
* to build a structure and then maps out an adiabatic potential
* surface defined by a pair of dihedrals

                    Fortran I/O Units Usage by CHARMM

        In order to keep CHARMM as machine independent as possible, all
specification of files is done through Fortran unit numbers.  Two unit
numbers have special signifigance, 5 and 6.  Unit 5 is the command file
interpreted by CHARMM.  Unit 6 is the output file for all printed
messages.  As commands are read from unit 5, they are echoed on unit 6.
All other unit numbers have no predefined meaning. The CHARMM OPEN
command may be used to assign files to units.

        The stream file in "STREAM file-specfication" may be assigned
to a logical unit between 100 and 119 (80 and 99 on Cray machines).
Logical unit 0 through 9 may be used for CHARMM internal file
handling.  We recommend logical units 10 through 79 for user data
files.


File: Usage, Node: AKMA, Up: Top, Next: Data Structures, Previous: I/O Units

                The CHARMM system of units: AKMA.

        CHARMM uses a distinct system of units, the AKMA system. I.e.
Angstroms, Kilocalories/Mole, Atomic mass units. All distances are
measured in Angstroms, energies in kcal/mole, mass in atomic mass units,
and charge is in units of electron charge. Using this system, the AMKA
unit of time is 4.888821E-14 seconds (based on the constants tabulated
in Abramowitz and Stegun (1970)), however, for all input and output,
the time is listed in picoseconds (20 AKMA time units is .978 picoseconds).
In some places, the users may specify values in AKMA time units, and
in some places both picosecond and AKMA time are output.

        Angles are given in degrees for the analysis and constraint
sections. In parameter files, the minimum positions of angles are
specified in degrees, but the force constants for angles, dihedrals, and
dihedral constraints are specified in kcal/mole/radian/radian.

        Any numbers used in the documentation may be assumed to be in
AKMA units unless otherwise noted.

                Data Structures You Should Understand

        There are a number of data structures that CHARMM manipulates.
Many of these data structures are important for most operations; others
which are less important, are described with the commands that use them.
Much more specific information is available in the various common blocks
whose extension is .fcm in the source directory, ~/charmm/source/fcm
([...CHARMM.SOURCE.FCM] on VAX).

        The important data structures are given below: Each data
structure name is followed by its abbreviation which is used as its name
in commands.

        1) Residue Topology File (RTF)
           The residue topology file stores the definitions of all
           residues. The atoms, atomic properties, bonds, bond angles,
           torsion angles, improper torsion angles, hydrogen bond donors
           and acceptors and antecedents, and non-bonded exclusions are
           all specified on a per residue basis. The term "residue" is
           somewhat historical, but can be any basic unit.

        2) The Parameters (PARA or PARM)
           The parameters specify the force constants, equilibrium
           geometries, van der Waals radii, and other such data needed
           for calculating the energy.

        3) Structure File (PSF)
           The structure file is the concatenation of
           information in the RTF. It specifies the information for the
           entire structure. It has a hierarchical organization wherein
           atoms are grouped into residues which are grouped into
           segments which comprise the structure. Each atom is uniquely
           identified within a residue by its IUPAC name, residue
           identifier, and its segment identifier. Identifiers may be up
           to 4 characters in length.

        4) The Internal Coordinates (IC)
           The internal coordinates data structure contains information
           concerning the relative positions of atoms within a structure.
           This data structure is most commonly used to build or modify
           cartesian coordinates from known or desired internal coordinate
           values. It is also used in conjunction with the analysis of
           normal modes. Since there are complete editing facilities,
           it can be used as a simple but powerful method of examining
           or analyzing structures.

        5) The Coordinates (COOR)
           The coordinates are the Cartesian coordinates for all the
           atoms in the PSF. There are two sets of coordinates provided.
           The main set is the default used for all operations involving
           the positions of the atoms. A comparison set (also called the
           reference set) is provided for a variety of purposes, such as
           a reference for rotation or operations which involve
           differences between coordinates for a particular molecule.
           Associated with each coordinate set is a general purpose
           weighting array (one element for each atom).

        6) The Non-bonded List (NBON)
           The non-bonded list contains the list of non-bonded
           interactions to be used in calculating the energies as well
           as optional information about the charge, dipole moment, and
           quadrapole moments of the residues. This data structure
           depends on the coordinates for its construction and must be
           periodically updated if the coordinates are being modified.

        7) The Hydrogen Bond List (HBON)
           The hydrogen bond list contains the list of hydrogen bonds.
           Like the non-bonded list, this data structure depends on the
           coordinates and must be periodically updated.

        8) The Constraints (CONS)
           There is a variety of available constraints. All data pertaining
           to constraints reside in this data structure.

        9) The Images data structure (IMAGES)
           The images data structure determines and defines the relative
           positions and orientations of any symmetric image of the primary
           molecule(s). The purpose of this data structure is to allow
           the simulation of crystal symmetry or the use of periodic
           boundary conditions. Also contined in this data structure is
           information concerning all nonbonded, H-bonds, and bonded
           interactions between primary and image atoms.

                    Files available for general use

        There are number of residue topology files, parameter files,
coordinates files and files of other data structures available. The most
important files generally available are residue topology and parameter
files. Both such classes of files are stored for general use in the
CnnPT: directories. The file names used for both these files
consists of an alphabetic part followed by a number, e.g. PARAM7.
There are two copies of each file; one with extension, .INP, which is a
character files used as an command file to generate the binary file,
with extension, .MOD. The .INP is meant for human eyes; the .MOD files
is meant for CHARMM to read efficiently. The numeric part of each name
is its version number. In general, one should use the highest version
number of a file.

        Although parameter files and toplogy files are separate,
they are usually associated, and they must be taken together when
generating a structure (PSF). For example, a parameter set for proteins
will not work with a DNA topology file.

        For information on the general use of directories, and the files
they contain, see the following sections.

                          Interfacing to CHARMM

        A mechanism has been provided to allow users of the
CHARMM to write their own special purpose subroutines which can be
incorporated into the system without threatening its integrity.

        There are six "hooks" into the CHARMM which have been
specially provided for casual modifiers. For detailed descriptions of
each of these hooks, consult the routine in
        ~/charmm/source/main/usersb.src 


1) USERSB

        The USER command invokes the subroutine, USERSB, and performs
no other action.  USERSB is a subroutine with no arguments.  However,
parameters may be passed to this subroutine via modules.
These modules store nearly all of the systems data.  These modules should be
created in the source directories for the version of the program you are using.

2) USERE

        A user supplied energy routine may be provided that will be
invoked on every energy evaluation. The force arrays should be
modified accordingly.

3) USRSEL

        If one need to be able to select atoms in a manner not
possible with the existing options, a user selection routine
may be specified. One such example would be for for selecting atoms
within a given rectangular solid, or other (nonsperical) solid.

4) USERNM

        Within VIBRAN, a user specified vector or mode may be
generated with this routine. One command that appends this motion
onto the existing set of vectors is "EDIT INCL USER integer".

5) USERF

        A user specified parameter fitting routine may be specified.

6) USRTIM

        A user specified time series routine may be provied for use in
computing correlation functions.

#_OLD ???? mfc  
#_OLD ???? mfc          To simplify the use of these hooks and to allow users to replace
#_OLD ???? mfc  subprograms in the CHARMM with their own versions of said
#_OLD ???? mfc  subprograms, the command procedure BUILD has been provided.  BUILD
#_OLD ???? mfc  will produce a private version of the CHARMM in your default USER
#_OLD ???? mfc  directory using your versions of USERSB and USERE.  The procedure
#_OLD ???? mfc  looks in your directory for USERSB.SRC and USERE.SRC.  If either file
#_OLD ???? mfc  (or both) is found, it is used in the make procedure of the CHARMM.
#_OLD ???? mfc  
#_OLD ???? mfc          BUILD command should always be used to generate a private
#_OLD ???? mfc  version of the CHARMM as it will always use the correct files for
#_OLD ???? mfc  linking.
#_OLD ???? mfc  
        Before attempting to write your own USER functions, you should
familiarize yourself with the information available onthe
implementation of CHARMM.

        This interface procedure is designed for short, one time
programs.  If a user written subroutine is of general use, the routine
should be rewritten to conform to parameter passing standards used in the
system and then will be incorporated into the central CHARMM.

        There are several utility routines available to a user routine.
Some of them are listed below.

        CALL GETE(X,Y,Z,...)  will cause the energy and forces to be
computed and values are saved  appropriately. For
this to work properly, NBONDS, HBONDS, and CODES must have been called.
This can be done by executing both the NBONds and HBONds command,
by the use of the UPDAte command, or by having previously found the
energy (minimization, dynamics, etc..).

        CALL PRINTE(...) will write the current energy
values (from common block values) to the specified unit (IUNIT).
It will also write out the cycle or iteration number and optionally
write out the standard header.

char            A character

del             The delimiter - a single character which is used to mark
                the end of a portion of a command. Initially, it is a
                dollar sign but can be changed using the DELIM command,
                see *note delim:(chmdoc/miscom.doc). It should be
                noted that the delimiter cannot be a character within
                any string it is supposed to delimit.

deldel          Two delimiters concatened together with no space in between.

int or integer  An integer

iupac           IUPAC name for an atom. Initially specified in the
                residue topology file.

keyword         A word, see below, serving to identify some option

range           equivalent to real real integer. The first real is the
                minimum value in the range, the second number is the
                maximum value in the range, and the third number gives
                the number of interval, i.e. lines or columns.

real            A real number. No decimal point is required for the
                number to be interpreted correctly

resid           Residue identifier (a string of upto 4 characters)

resname         Residue name (type of residue. e.g. GUA)

segid           Segment identifier (a string of upto 4 characters)

string          An ordered set of characters

tag             A string which is a tag, i.e. no embedded spaces.

title           A series of 1 to 32 lines of text (max 80 characters per line)
                each starting with a "*". The title is terminated by a
                line which an asterisk "*" as the first character.
                Used for commenting files.

data structure  A collection of arrays, scalars, and possibly other
                data structures which are related by part of a larger
                entity. For example, a coordinate set is a data
                structure which hold the three dimensional positions of
                atoms. This data structure consists of 1 scalar and
                three arrays. The scalar is the number of coordinates;
                the three arrays are the X, Y, and Z components of the
                coordinates.

Internal        bonds, angles, torsions, improper torsions.
coordinates     Also, a data structure used for constructing coordinates.
