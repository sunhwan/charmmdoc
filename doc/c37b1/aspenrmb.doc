           Atomic Solvation Parameter  Model with Implicit Membrane

Purpose: ASPENRMB is an extended version of ASPENR that includes the effect of 
Implicit Membrane (IM) in surface area caculations. 
ASPENRMB can be used to calculate  solvation free energy 
and forces based on the solvent accessible Surface Area (SA) of each atom,  
using Atomic Solvation Parameters (ASP).

Gsolv = Sum ( Gamma_i * ASA_i + Gref_i )

See also  aspener.doc

  The combined use of the GBIM and ASPENRMB modules permits  calculation of 
the solvation  energy in the frames of the GBSA\IM model(Spassov et al., 2002)

  Gsolv = Gpol + Gnp

where the polar contribution  Gpol is calculated using the GBIM module
(See gbim.doc) 

and the  non-polar (hydrophobic) energy term is approximated by:
       N
Gnp = Sum ( Gamma_i * ASA_i + Gref_i )
      i=1                

Gamma_i is a parameter describing the SA contribution of  atom i to the
non-polar energy term; ASA_i is the surface area of atom i with radius RvdW_i,
Gref_i is a reference solvation energy. The most popular GBSA models use
uniform ASP parameters, i.e., Gamma_i = const.

[SYNTAX ASPENRMB functions]


The ASP / Implicit Membrane  specifications are similar to ASPENR and can be
specified any time prior to an energy calculation and can be input either
through reading a file or parsed directly off the command line - although the
file route is more usual.  Once turned on, the ASP energy term is in place
during the course of the CHARMM run, i.e., it cannot be turned off
except using the skipe command, see *note Skipe (chmdoc/energy.doc).

Reading surf file:  open unit 1 read memb30.surf
                    read saim unit 1
                    close unit 1

The extended ASPENR module permits the effect of an Implicit Membrane
to be included in the computation of solvation energies and forces
based on the surface area models, such as that proposed by Wesson and
Eisenberg (see  aspener.doc) or only for the non-polar contribution to
solvation energy, as in  GBSA/IM models.

The values of the required parameters are read from a "surf" file
which has the following syntax:

* file:  memb30.surf
*

!       They are in units of cal/(mol*A**2).

END

Notes:
- ANY refers to any residue type
- A negative radius causes the atom to be ignored (such as hydrogens,...)
- Atom name can use CHARMM wildcard rules (not residue names).
- These commands ar eprocessed sequentially.  If an atom is matched by
  more than one line the LAST line is used.
- This file is free field format.
- If the membrane parameters are omitted or membrane thickness is set
  to zero, the calculations are carried out without a membrane in the model.

                                   Examples


The energy calculations/simulations/minimizations with the ASP / IM
potential are activated using the following call:

       open unit 1 read form name test.surf
       read saim unit 1
       close unit 1

When you do an energy calculation, dynamics or minimization with
ASPENRMB, you get columns in the log file printout with energy terms
for ASP, e.g., 

ENER ENR:  Eval#    ENERgy     Delta-E        GRMS
ENER INTERN:         BONDs      ANGLes      UREY-b   DIHEdrals   IMPRopers

and the same during minimization and dynamics.
