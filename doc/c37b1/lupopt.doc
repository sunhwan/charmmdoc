                        Low Energy Path OPTmization

     This method optimizes a low energy path between a series of molecular
structures.  Energy minimization is done with constraints on center of mass
translation, rotation and orthogonality of step to path vector.

Algorithm description:
----------------------
Work is in Caretsian space, path optimized by constrained steepest
descent.  See C.Choi & R.Elber, J.Chem.Phys. 94:751-760 (1991).

     1. An initial conformational path is read in 
        a) linear interpolation between MAIN and COMP coordinates
        b) series of structures in CHARMM COOR files (see LUPINI)
        structures I=1,2,...,NPATH
     2. For each structure inside path I=2,3,...,NPATH-1
        a. Path vector is computed 
        b. A steepest descent step is taken, subject to
           rigid-body and path constraints (see LUPCNS)
        c. Step is accepted if energy decreases
        d. Convergence is checked by monitoring energy change
     3. If procedure has converged along whole path, stop;
        otherwise return to step 2, possibly decreasing step.


Path initialization: 
--------------------
Option 1 is simplest, but may lead to very poor initial guess, even
for buatne t->g!
Option 2 is more involved, but allows for more flexibility.
E.g. model structires along a straight line in dihedral space may
be generated from CHARMM or QUANTA, or a TRAVEL path may be input.


Path optimization:
------------------
For each structure gradient components along 7 LUP constraints are
removed (see LUPCNS) and a steepest descent (SD) step is performed.
The step length is formally STEP, due to CHARMM conventions it is
actually STEP*SQRT(NATOM), i.e. 

      Xi -> Xi - (STEP/GNORM)*Gi

where Xi -coordinate, Gi - gradient component,
      GNORM = SQRT[(Sum_i Gi**2)/Natom]

If the energy of the new structure is lower than before, the step is
accepted and new coords are stored on HEAP; if the energy is higher,
the step is rejected and coordinates are reset.
If steps are rejected for more than half of the structures in a
cycle, STEP is divided by 2.

Progress in path optimization is monitored by printing out energies
of all current structures every LPRI cycles.


Path constraints:
-----------------
The 7 constraints involve : 1-6 : rigid body translations and
rotations and 7: the path vector. See LUPCNS
As described by Ron Elber, the constraints are linear in Cartesian
coordinates, i.e. their Cartesian gradinets are 3*Natom dimensional
constant vectors. To simplify procedure the vectors are
orthonormalized. Gradient projections along these vectors are then
eliminated.

                                Memory Usage


The INTEGER*4 arrays of heap pointers IBX,IBY,IBZ
are given a fixed dimension in LUPOPT:  MXPATH=200.
This can be changed by hand.

Memory could be a problem for large systems.
The path structures are stored on the HEAP : NPATH*3*NATOM REAL*8
Constraint vectors, also on heap             7*3*NATOM     REAL*8
One working coordinate set                   3*NATOM       REAL*8

Altogether:                              (NPATH+8)*3*NATOM REAL*8
+ neglible extras for pointers and coorio
