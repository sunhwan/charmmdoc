               based on the Q-Chem interface by Lee Woodcock

        Ab initio program Gaussian09 is connected to CHARMM program in a 
QM/MM method. This method is based on the interface to the GAMESS (US
version), the latter being an extension of the QUANTUM code which is
described in J. Comp. Chem., Vol. 11, No. 6, 700-733 (1990).

The interface currently provides basic functionality for QM/MM calculations 
of energy & gradient. It can also be used in conjunction with the 
Solvent Macromolecule Boundary Potential (SMBP; see pbeq.doc)

        The Gaussian09 QM potential is initialized with the GAUS command.

[SYNTAX GAUS]

GAUS     [REMOve] [EXGRoup] (atom selection)

REMOve:  Classical energies within QM atoms are removed.

EXGRoup: QM/MM Electrostatics for link host groups removed.

The NOGUess option (see qchem.doc) is always implied!


     Example:

     ENVI g09exe     "/share/apps/gaussian/g09/g09"
     ENVI g09fchk    "/share/apps/gaussian/g09/formchk"
     ENVI g09cmd     "G09CMD"
     ENVI g09profile "G09PROFILE"
     ENVI g09inp     "g1"

CHARMM input scripts are the same as before except the addition of ENVIronment
commands and the GAUS command itself. The Gaussian parameters are specified
in an additional file as defined by the G09CMD environment variable. The 
environment section in the CHARMM input defines the Gaussian program location,
the parameter filenames as well as the input/output filenames and scratch 
directory: 


     Use of ENVIronment commands in the CHARMM input file:

     ENVI G09EXE       "/share/apps/gaussian/g09/g09"
     ENVI G09FCHK      "/share/apps/gaussian/g09/formchk"
     ENVI G09CMD       "G09CMD"
     ENVI G09PROFILE   "G09PROFILE"
     ENVI G09INP       "g1"
     ENVI GAUSS_SCRDIR "/scratch/"

1. G09EXE and G09FCHK point to the Gaussian as well as the formchk executable

2. G09CMD specifies the file that provides the calculation parameters (see below) 

3. G09PROFILE is a shell input file that can be used to source additional
   env variables that might be needed for Gaussian; usually, however, an
   empty file will do (but it has to be provided)

4. G09INP provides the name of the input/output files. For example, "g1"
   will produce g1.inp and g1.log. The input file is automatically generated
   by the interface 

5. GAUSS_SCRDIR points to the scratch file; it might be more useful to
   define this in the submission (pbs) script 

Gaussian parameter file G09CMD
------------------------------

The structure is evident in the following example for a 
B3LYP/6-31G* calculation of a neutral molecule. The $pop
section allows to provide options for population analysis 
(e.g., calculation of Merz-Kollman ESP charges by specifying 
"pop=mk" beneath the $pop keyword), $extra allows for general 
additional options to Gaussian, and $nproc specifies the 
number of processors Gaussian should use.
