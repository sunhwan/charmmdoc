The multipole (MTP) module allows to include electrostatic
interactions between multipolar charge distributions and point charges
or between several multipolar charge distributions.

INTERACTION TYPES INCLUDED
--------------------------

Currently interactions up to Rank 2 (quadrupole) are fully implemented
and interactions up to Rank 3 (octopole) are included for linear
molecules. In detail, the following components are available:

3 components for dipole moments
5 components for quadrupole moments
1 component for octopole moments

The interactions of these components include interactions of all
components with point charges as well as the interactions of the
components with each other.

The number of components needed for a given intermolecular interaction
depends on the highest multipole rank on each atom as well as on the
molecular geometry.

MTP INPUT FILES
---------------

A typical input sequence to activate MTP looks as follows:

open unit 40 card read name mtp.dma
MTP MTPUNIT 40
close unit 40

where mtp.dma is the name of a file containing parameters necessary
for MTP (see below).

MTP parameters are read initially by the MTP module and used in 
calculating energies and gradients.


A typical MTP parameter file looks like the following:

 1               ! number of molecules (a)
 1               ! number of types of molecules (a)

 2               ! number of sites (b-1)
 533 534 0 0 0   ! reference atoms (b-2)
 QFLC            ! and QFLC (b-3)
 1.151           ! Re for QFLC (in angstrom) (b-3)
 NoLINT          ! No linear triatomic (b-4)
 0 0             ! reference range (b-5)

 533             ! reference atom (c)
 2               ! rank (Limit 2)
  0.0648         ! charge (Q0)
  0.3686         ! charge (Q')  Q = Q0 + Q' ( R - Re )
  0.5139         ! qu10 (Q0)
 -1.1332         ! qu10 (Q')
  0.3787         ! qu20 (Q0)
 -0.5204         ! qu20 (Q')

 534             ! reference atom
 2               ! rank (Limit 2)
 -0.0648         ! charge (Q0)
 -0.3686         ! charge (Q')
 -0.3230         ! qu10 (Q0)
  0.9811         ! qu10 (Q')
  0.5716         ! qu20 (Q0)
 -0.1324         ! qu20 (Q')

(a) The 1st line specifies the total number of molecules containing
 MTP, and the 2nd line the number of types of MTP molecules.

(b) Parameters for each type of molecule should be given.
 (b-1) The number of sites is the number of points (atoms) in a
  molecule that are described by MTP.
 (b-2) A line with the MTP atom indices should follow, which are
  atom numbers used in the CHARMM coordinate file. In the current
  implementation, the total number of MTP atoms in a single molecule
  cannot exceed 3.  Add zeros after the atom numbers on this line so
  that the total number of integer numbers on this line is 5.
 (b-3) If the following line contains QFLC, the equilibrium bond
  length Re should be given in angstrom on the next line and each
  moment is described by Q = Q0 + Q' ( R - Re ), where R is the
  interatomic distance in angstrom, Re is the equilibrium bond length
  given after QFLC, Q0 is the moment at R = Re, and Q' is the slope
  of Q with respect to the change in bond distance.  QFLC is allowed
  only for diatomic molecules at present.  If static moments are to be
  used, put NoQFLC instead of QFLC.  In the case of NoQFLC, no
  equilibrium bond length should be given on the next line.
 (b-4) Following QFLC/NoQFLC line, LINT/NoLINT should be given, where
  LINT is used for linear triatomic molecule and NoLINT otherwise.
 (b-5) Then, the range of atoms should be given.  This is used when
  there is more than one MTP molecule of the same type.  The order of
  atoms in each molecule should be identical. The initial and final
  atom indices are used on this line.  If there is only a single
  molecule of this type, just use '0 0'.

(c) The parameters for each MTP site in a molecule follow.  The atom
 index is given first, and then the rank is given.  Rank 0 is used for
 charge, rank 1 up to dipole, and rank 2 up to quadrupole moments.  In
 the case of QFLC, Q0 and Q' values for the atom are given for each of
 the following components: Q00 / Q1Z / Q20 / Q30 for rank 0 / 1 / 2 / 3.
 In the case of NoQFLC, only Q0 values are given for the following
 components: Q1Z Q1X Q1Y / Q20 Q21C Q21S Q22C Q22S for rank 1 / 2.
 Here, Q00 means charge, Q1[XYZ] X, Y, and Z components of dipole
 moments, Q2* quadrupole moments, etc.

(d) Part (c) is repeated for each MTP site (atom) in a molecule.

(e) Parts (b)-(c) are repeated for each type of MTP molecule.

More example inputs are provided in the MTP test cases 
mtp-no-h2o.inp, mtp-h2o-trimer.inp and mtp-cluster.inp

HOW TO OBTAIN ATOMIC MULTIPOLE PARAMETERS
-----------------------------------------

The parameters that should be provided in part (c) can be obtained
from quantum chemical calculations and the GDMA program. A typical 
procedure is as follows:

(1) Prepare an input file for Gaussian 03 (G03).  Checkpoint file
    should be specified.  HF, DFT, or MP2 can be used to generate MTP
    parameters.

(2) Run the G03 job.

(3) Convert the checkpoint file into a formatted file by 'formchk'
    command of G03, which will be used by GDMA.

(4) Prepare GDMA input file.  For details, refer to the following web
    site:
    http://www-stone.ch.cam.ac.uk/documentation/gdma/README.html

(5) Execute GDMA and obtain a punch file. Punch file contains
    multipole moment parameters, which can be used in MD simulation.


The multipole scheme used by GDMA and in the MTP module is spherical
tensor notation. If multipoles of another program are to be used or
compared, it should be considered that they may be in Cartesian tensor
notation and have to be transformed to spherical tensor notation
first.

In order to include a new parameter set, it is important to check
whether the order of atom numbers is in agreement with the sign
convention used for the reference axis system. E.g. for linear
molecules, the sign of the dipole- and octopole moments taken from
GDMA needs to be adapted to the order of the atoms. For CO, if the C
atom comes first in the atom ordering, the signs are reversed with
respect to the standard orientation in a GAUSSIAN calculation which
puts the oxygen in the positive side of the coordinate system and the
carbon on the negative side of the coordinate system.

GRADIENTS
---------

The gradients of static atomic multipole moments are composed of two
components:

1) A component depending on the atom position on which the multipole
moment is placed. This component is included generally for all
multipole interactions in the code.

2) A component depending on the reference axis system in which the
orientation of the multipole moment is defined, i.e. on the positions
of all atoms defining the corresponding reference axis system. These 
components have to be coded separately for each new reference axis 
system. Currently, they are included for linear molecules, linear 
triatomic and water. For details, see the comments in the code for 
each multipole interaction subroutine.

For the gradients of fluctuating atomic multipole moments (QFLC
option), complete gradients include an additional term accounting for
the changes of moments with molecular geometry. This contribution is
still being tested and has not been incorporated in the MTP module
yet.

COMBINATION WITH ANHARMONIC BOND POTENTIALS
-------------------------------------------

Besides harmonic potentials for bond stretching and bending, other
types of potential may be used, such as Morse potential, RRKR
potential, KKY water potential, etc. The potentials mentioned above
have been tested (and results from their use are in the literature),
but have not been included in the current distribution of CHARMM.
